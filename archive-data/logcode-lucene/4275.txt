+/**
+ * Support for index-time and query-time joins.
+ * <h2>Index-time joins</h2>
+ *
+ * <p>The index-time joining support joins while searching, where joined
+ *   documents are indexed as a single document block using
+ *   {@link org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter#addDocuments IndexWriter.addDocuments()}.  
+ *   This is useful for any normalized content (XML documents or database tables).  In database terms, all rows for all
+ *   joined tables matching a single row of the primary table must be
+ *   indexed as a single document block, with the parent document
+ *   being last in the group.</p>
+ * 
+ * <p>When you index in this way, the documents in your index are divided
+ *   into parent documents (the last document of each block) and child
+ *   documents (all others).  You provide a {@link org.apache.lucene.search.Filter} that identifies the
+ *   parent documents, as Lucene does not currently record any information
+ *   about doc blocks.</p>
+ * 
+ * <p>At search time, use {@link
+ *   org.apache.lucene.search.join.ToParentBlockJoinQuery} to remap/join
+ *   matches from any child {@link org.apache.lucene.search.Query} (ie, a
+ *   query that matches only child documents) up to the parent document
+ *   space.  The
+ *   resulting query can then be used as a clause in any query that
+ *   matches parent.</p>
+ * 
+ * <p>If you only care about the parent documents matching the query, you
+ *   can use any collector to collect the parent hits, but if you'd also
+ *   like to see which child documents match for each parent document,
+ *   use the {@link org.apache.lucene.search.join.ToParentBlockJoinCollector} to collect the hits. Once the
+ *   search is done, you retrieve a {@link
+ *   org.apache.lucene.search.grouping.TopGroups} instance from the
+ *   {@link org.apache.lucene.search.join.ToParentBlockJoinCollector#getTopGroups ToParentBlockJoinCollector.getTopGroups()} method.</p>
+ * 
+ * <p>To map/join in the opposite direction, use {@link
+ *   org.apache.lucene.search.join.ToChildBlockJoinQuery}.  This wraps
+ *   any query matching parent documents, creating the joined query
+ *   matching only child documents.
+ * 
+ * <h2>Query-time joins</h2>
+ * 
+ * <p>
+ *   The query time joining is index term based and implemented as two pass search. The first pass collects all the terms from a fromField
+ *   that match the fromQuery. The second pass returns all documents that have matching terms in a toField to the terms
+ *   collected in the first pass.
+ * </p>
+ * <p>Query time joining has the following input:</p>
+ * <ul>
+ *   <li><code>fromField</code>: The from field to join from.
+ *   <li><code>fromQuery</code>:  The query executed to collect the from terms. This is usually the user specified query.
+ *   <li><code>multipleValuesPerDocument</code>:  Whether the fromField contains more than one value per document
+ *   <li><code>scoreMode</code>:  Defines how scores are translated to the other join side. If you don't care about scoring
+ *   use {@link org.apache.lucene.search.join.ScoreMode#None} mode. This will disable scoring and is therefore more
+ *   efficient (requires less memory and is faster).
+ *   <li><code>toField</code>: The to field to join to
+ * </ul>
+ * <p>
+ *   Basically the query-time joining is accessible from one static method. The user of this method supplies the method
+ *   with the described input and a <code>IndexSearcher</code> where the from terms need to be collected from. The returned
+ *   query can be executed with the same <code>IndexSearcher</code>, but also with another <code>IndexSearcher</code>.
+ *   Example usage of the {@link org.apache.lucene.search.join.JoinUtil#createJoinQuery(String, boolean, String, org.apache.lucene.search.Query, org.apache.lucene.search.IndexSearcher, org.apache.lucene.search.join.ScoreMode)
+ *   JoinUtil.createJoinQuery()} :
+ * </p>
+ * <pre class="prettyprint">
+ *   String fromField = "from"; // Name of the from field
+ *   boolean multipleValuesPerDocument = false; // Set only yo true in the case when your fromField has multiple values per document in your index
+ *   String toField = "to"; // Name of the to field
+ *   ScoreMode scoreMode = ScoreMode.Max // Defines how the scores are translated into the other side of the join.
+ *   Query fromQuery = new TermQuery(new Term("content", searchTerm)); // Query executed to collect from values to join to the to values
+ * 
+ *   Query joinQuery = JoinUtil.createJoinQuery(fromField, multipleValuesPerDocument, toField, fromQuery, fromSearcher, scoreMode);
+ *   TopDocs topDocs = toSearcher.search(joinQuery, 10); // Note: toSearcher can be the same as the fromSearcher
+ *   // Render topDocs...
+ * </pre>
