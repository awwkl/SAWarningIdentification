   to track the respective stats.  Advanced users with client code manipulating these objects will 
   need to update their code accordingly.  See SOLR-7325 and SOLR-7336 for more info.
 
-* Solr has internally been upgraded to use Jetty 9. See SOLR-4839 for full details, but there are a few key details all Solr users should know when upgrading:
-  **  It is no longer possible to run "java -jar start.jar" from inside the server directory.
-      The bin/solr script is the only supported way to run Solr. This is necessary to support
-      HTTP and HTTPS modules in Jetty which can be selectively enabled by the bin/solr scripts.
-      In case you have a pressing need to run solr the old way, you can run
-      "java -jar start.jar --module=http" to get the same behavior as before.
-  **  The way SSL support is configured has been changed. Before this release,
-      the SOLR_SSL_OPTS property configured in solr.in.sh (linux/mac) or solr.in.cmd (windows)
-      was used to enable/disable SSL but starting in 5.2.0, new properties named as
-      SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE, SOLR_SSL_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD, SOLR_SSL_TRUST_STORE,
-      SOLR_SSL_TRUST_STORE_PASSWORD, SOLR_SSL_NEED_CLIENT_AUTH and SOLR_SSL_WANT_CLIENT_AUTH
-      have been introduced. The bin/solr scripts configure the SOLR_SSL_OPTS property
-      automatically based on the above new properties.
-      You should *not* configure the SOLR_SSL_OPTS property directly inside solr.in.{sh,cmd}.
-  **  Support for SOLR_SSL_PORT property has been removed. Instead use the regular SOLR_PORT
-      property or specify the port while invoking the bin/solr script using the "-p" switch.
-  **  Furthermore, it is now possible to configure the HTTP client with
-      different SSL properties than the ones used for Jetty using the same files.
-  **  Please refer to the "Enabling SSL" section in the Solr Reference Guide for complete details.
