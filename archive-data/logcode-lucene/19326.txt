  * LUCENE-1422, LUCENE-1693: New TokenStream API that uses a new class called 
-   AttributeSource instead of the now deprecated Token class. All attributes
-   that the Token class had have been moved into separate classes:
-   TermAttribute, OffsetAttribute, PositionIncrementAttribute, 
-   PayloadAttribute, TypeAttribute and FlagsAttribute. The new API
-   is much more flexible; it allows to combine the Attributes arbitrarily 
-   and also to define custom Attributes. The new API has the same performance
-   as the old next(Token) approach.
-   For conformance with this new API Tee-/SinkTokenizer was deprecated
-   and replaced by a new TeeSinkTokenFilter. (Michael Busch, Uwe Schindler;
-   additional contributions and bug fixes by Daniel Shane, Doron Cohen)

    These methods can be used to avoid additional calls to doc().
