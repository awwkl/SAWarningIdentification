+Changes in runtime behavior
+
+ 1. FuzzyQuery can no longer throw a TooManyClauses exception. If a 
+    FuzzyQuery expands to more than BooleanQuery.maxClauseCount 
+    terms only the BooleanQuery.maxClauseCount most similar terms 
+    go into the rewritten query and thus the exception is avoided.
+    (Christoph)
+
+ 2.	Changed system property from "org.apache.lucene.lockdir" to
+    "org.apache.lucene.lockDir", so that its casing follows the existing
+    pattern used in other Lucene system properties. (Bernhard)
