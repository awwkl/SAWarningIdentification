  5. Optimize fuzzy queries so the standard fuzzy queries with a prefix 
     of 0 now run 20-50% faster (Patch #31882).

+ 6. A Version of BooleanScorer (BooleanScorer2) added that delivers documents 
+    in  increasing order and implements skipTo. For queries with required or forbidden 
+    clauses it may be faster than the old BooleanScorer, for BooleanQueries consisting 
+    only of optional clauses it is probably slower. The new BooleanScorer is now the
