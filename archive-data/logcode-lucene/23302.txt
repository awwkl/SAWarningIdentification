+ByteCount indicates the number of bytes in Bits. It is typically (SegSize/8)+1.
 BitCount indicates the number of bits that are currently set in Bits.
 Bits contains one bit for each document indexed. When the bit corresponding to a document
 number is set, that document is marked as deleted. Bit ordering is from least to most
 significant. Thus, if Bits contains two bytes, 0x00 and 0x02, then document 9 is marked as
 deleted.
+DGaps represents sparse bit-vectors more efficiently than Bits. It is made of DGaps on
+indexes of nonzero bytes in Bits, and the nonzero bytes themselves. The number of nonzero
+bytes in Bits (NonzeroBytesCount) is not stored.
+For example, if there are 8000 bits and only bits 10,12,32 are set, DGaps would be used:
