+                <p>
+                        The purpose of this document is to outline plans for
+                        making <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene">
+                        Jakarta Lucene</a> work as a more general drop-in
+                        component.  It makes the assumption that this is an
+                        objective for the Lucene user and development community.
+                </p>
+                <p>
+                        The best reference is <a href="http://www.htdig.org">
+                        htDig</a>, though it is not quite as sophisticated as
+                        Lucene, it has a number of features that make it
+                        desireable.  It however is a traditional c-compiled app
+                        which makes it somewhat unpleasent to install on some
+                        platforms (like Solaris!).
+                </p>
+                <p>
+                        This plan is being submitted to the Lucene developer
+                        community for an initial reaction, advice, feedback and
+                        consent.  Following this it will be submitted to the
+                        Lucene user community for support.  Although, I'm (Andy
+                        Oliver) capable of providing these enhancements by 
+                        myself, I'd of course prefer to work on them in concert 
+                        with others.
+                </p>
+                <p>
+                        While I'm outlaying a fairly large featureset, these can
+                        be implemented incrementally of course (and are probably
+                        best if done that way).

+        <section name="Goal and Objectives">
+                <p>
+                        The goal is to provide features to Lucene that allow it
+                        to be used as a dropin search engine.  It should provide
+                        many of the features of projects like <a
+                        href="http://www.htdig.org">htDig</a> while surpassing
+                        them with unique Lucene features and capabillities such as
+                        easy installation on and java-supporting platform,
+                        and support for document fields and field searches.  And 
+                        of course, <a href="http://apache.org/LICENSE">
+                        a pragmatic software license</a>.
+                </p>
+                <p>
+                        To reach this goal we'll implement code to support the
+                        following objectives that augment but do not replace
+                        the current Lucene featureset.  
+                </p>

+                                Document Location Independance - meaning mapping
+                                real contexts to runtime contexts.
+                                Essentially, if the document is at
+                                /var/www/htdocs/mydoc.html, I probably want it
+                                indexed as
+                                http://www.bigevilmegacorp.com/mydoc.html.

+                                Standard methods of creating central indicies -
+                                file system indexing is probably less useful in
+                                many environments than is *remote* indexing (for
+                                instance http).  I would suggest that most folks
+                                would prefer that general functionality be
+                                suppored by Lucene instead of having to write
+                                code for every indexing project.  Obviously, if
+                                what they are doing is *special* they'll have to
+                                code, but general document indexing accross
+                                webservers would not qualify.

+                        Indexers are standard crawlers.  They go crawl a file
+                        system, ftp site, web site, etc. to create the index.
+                        These standard indexers may not make ALL of Lucene's
+                        functionality available, though they should be able to
+                        make most of it available through configuration.

+                        A configurable registry of document types, their

+                        extension.  This should map both MIME -> factory

+                        An interface for classes which create document objects
+                        for particular file types.  Examples:
+                        HTMLDocumentFactory, DOCDocumentFactory,
+                        XLSDocumentFactory, XML DocumentFactory.

+                        A class taht maps standard fields from the
+                        DocumentFactories into *fields* in the Document objects
+                        they create.  I suggest that a regular expression system
+                        or xpath might be the most universal way to do this.
+                        For instance if perhaps I had an XML factory that
+                        represented XML elements as fields, I could map content
+                        from particular fields to ther fields or supress them
+                        entirely.  We could even make this configurable.

+                
+                        for example:
+                </p>
+                <ul>
+                        <li>
+                                htmldoc.properties
+                        </li>
+                        <li>
+                        suppress=*
+                        </li>
+                        <li>
+                        author=content:g/author\:\ ........................................./
+                        </li>
+                        <li>
+                        author.suppress=false
+                        </li>
+                        <li>
+                        title=content:g/title\:\ ........................................./
+                        </li>
+                        <li>
+                        title.suppress=false
+                        </li>
+                </ul>
+                <p>                
+                        In this example we map html documents such that all 
+                        fields are suppressed but author and title.  We map 
+                        author and title to anything in the content matching 
+                        author: (and x characters).  Okay my regular expresions 
+                        suck but hopefully you get the idea.

+                        We might also consider eliminating the DocumentFactory 
+                        entirely by making an AbstractDocument from which the 
+                        current document object would inherit from.  I 
+                        experimented with this locally, and it was a relatively 
+                        minor code change and there was of course no difference 
+                        in performance.  The Document Factory classes would 
+                        instead be instances of various subclasses of 
+                        AbstractDocument.

+                <p>
+                        My inspiration for this is HTDig (http://www.htdig.org/).  
+                        While this goes slightly beyond what HTDig provides by 
+                        providing field mapping (where HTDIG is just interested 
+                        in Strings/numbers wherever they are found), it provides 
+                        at least what I would need to use this as a dropin for 
+                        most places I contract at (with the obvious exception of 
+                        a default set of content handlers which would of course 
+                        develop naturally over time).
+                </p>
+                <p>
+                        I am able to certainly contribute to this effort if the 
+                        development community is open to it.  I'd suggest we do 
+                        it iteratively in stages and not aim for all of this at 
+                        once (for instance leave out the field mapping at first).

+                        Anyhow, please give me some feedback, counter 
+                        suggestions, let me know if I'm way off base or out of 
+                        line, etc. -Andy
