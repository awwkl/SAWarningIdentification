+powerful full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, dynamic

+Solr is written in Java and runs as a standalone full-text search server
+within a servlet container such as <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org">Tomcat</a>.
+Solr uses the <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/">Lucene Java</a>
+search library at it's core for full-text indexing and search, and has
+REST-like HTTP/XML and JSON APIs that make it easy to use from virtually
+any programming language.  Solr's powerful external configuration allow it to
+be tailored to almost any type of application without Java coding, and
+it has an extensive plugin architecture when more advanced
+customization is required.

       <title>What Is Solr?</title>
-      <p>
-        Solr is an open source enterprise search server based on the
-        <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/">Lucene Java</a> search library, with XML/HTTP and JSON APIs,
-        hit highlighting, faceted search, caching, replication, a web administration interface and many more features.
-        It runs in a Java servlet container such as <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org">Tomcat</a>.

+<p>
+Solr is the popular, blazing fast open source enterprise search
+platform from the Apache Lucene project.  Its major features include
+powerful full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, dynamic
+clustering, database integration, and rich document (e.g., Word, PDF)
+handling.  Solr is highly scalable, providing distributed search and
+index replication, and it powers the search and navigation features of
+many of the world's largest internet sites.
+</p>
+<p>
+Solr is written in Java and runs as a standalone full-text search server
+within a servlet container such as <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org">Tomcat</a>.
+Solr uses the <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/">Lucene Java</a>
+search library at it's core for full-text indexing and search, and has
+REST-like HTTP/XML and JSON APIs that make it easy to use from virtually
+any programming language.  Solr's powerful external configuration allow it to
+be tailored to almost any type of application without Java coding, and
+it has an extensive plugin architecture when more advanced
+customization is required.
