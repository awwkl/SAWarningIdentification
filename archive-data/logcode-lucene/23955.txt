-This is the Solr Project
+Welcome to the Apache Solr project!
+-----------------------------------
+
+This file is not intended to be a comprehensive source of documentation.  
+
+For a complete description of the Solr project, team composition, source
+code repositories, and other details, please see the Solr incubation web site at
+http://incubator.apache.org/projects/solr.html.
+
+
+
+Instructions for Building Apache Solr
+-------------------------------------
+
+1. Download the J2SE 5.0 JDK (Java Development Kit) or later from http://java.sun.com.
+   You will need the JDK installed, and the %JAVA_HOME%\bin directory included
+   on your command path.  To test this, issue a "java -version" command from your
+   shell and verify that the Java version is 5.0 or later.
+
+2. Download the Apache Ant binary distribution from http://ant.apache.org.
+   You will need Ant installed and the %ANT_HOME%\bin directory included on your
+   command path.  To test this, issue a "ant -version" command from your
+   shell and verify that Ant is available.
+
+3. Download the Apache Solr source distribution, linked from the above incubator
+   web site.  Expand the distribution to a folder of your choice, e.g. c:\solr.
+
+4. Navigate to that folder and issue an "ant" command to see the available options
+   for building, testing, and packaging solr.
