 Upgrading from Solr 1.2
 -----------------------
+IMPORTANT UPGRADE NOTE: In a master/slave configuration, all searchers/slaves
+should be upgraded before the master!  If the master were to be updated
+first, the older searchers would not be able to read the new index format.
+
+Older Apache Solr installations can be upgraded by replacing
+the relevant war file with the new version.  No changes to configuration
+files should be needed.  
 
-Solr 1.3 includes a newer version of Lucene (2.3.1).  The new index 
-format is not readable by older versions of Lucene. Existing indexes 
-will be automatically converted to the new format after the first 
-<update> command.  Be sure to backup your index before upgrading in 
-case you need to downgrade.
+This version of Solr contains a new version of Lucene implementing
+an updated index format.  This version of Solr/Lucene can still read
+and update indexes in the older formats, and will convert them to the new
+format on the first index change.  Be sure to backup your index before 
+upgrading in case you need to downgrade.
 
 Solr now recognizes HTTP Request headers related to HTTP Caching (see
 RFC 2616 sec13) and will by default respond with "304 Not Modified"
