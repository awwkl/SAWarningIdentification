 ======================= Release 2.4.0 (estimated: 2008-09-30) =======================
 
-NOTE:  In a minor change to Lucene's backward compatibility policy, we are now allowing the Fieldable interface to have
-changes, within reason, and made on a case-by-case basis.  If an application implements it's own Fieldable, please be aware
-  of this.  Otherwise, no need to be concerned.  For more details see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1349.
-  This is in effect for all 2.X releases, starting with 2.4.  Also note, that in all likelihood, Fieldable will be changed
-  in 3.0.
