+/**
+ *  Unicode collation support.
+ *  <p>
+ *  <code>Collation</code> converts each token into its binary <code>CollationKey</code> 
+ *  using the provided <code>Collator</code>, allowing it to be stored as an index term.
+ *  </p>
+ * 
+ * <h2>Use Cases</h2>
+ * 
+ * <ul>
+ *   <li>
+ *     Efficient sorting of terms in languages that use non-Unicode character 
+ *     orderings.  (Lucene Sort using a Locale can be very slow.) 
+ *   </li>
+ *   <li>
+ *     Efficient range queries over fields that contain terms in languages that 
+ *     use non-Unicode character orderings.  (Range queries using a Locale can be
+ *     very slow.)
+ *   </li>
+ *   <li>
+ *     Effective Locale-specific normalization (case differences, diacritics, etc.).
+ *     ({@link org.apache.lucene.analysis.core.LowerCaseFilter} and 
+ *     {@link org.apache.lucene.analysis.miscellaneous.ASCIIFoldingFilter} provide these services
+ *     in a generic way that doesn't take into account locale-specific needs.)
+ *   </li>
+ * </ul>
+ * 
+ * <h2>Example Usages</h2>
+ * 
+ * <h3>Farsi Range Queries</h3>
+ * <pre class="prettyprint">
+ *   // "fa" Locale is not supported by Sun JDK 1.4 or 1.5
+ *   Collator collator = Collator.getInstance(new Locale("ar"));
+ *   CollationKeyAnalyzer analyzer = new CollationKeyAnalyzer(collator);
+ *   RAMDirectory ramDir = new RAMDirectory();
+ *   IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(ramDir, new IndexWriterConfig(analyzer));
+ *   Document doc = new Document();
+ *   doc.add(new TextField("content", "\u0633\u0627\u0628", Field.Store.YES));
+ *   writer.addDocument(doc);
+ *   writer.close();
+ *   IndexReader ir = DirectoryReader.open(ramDir);
+ *   IndexSearcher is = new IndexSearcher(ir);
+ * 
+ *   QueryParser aqp = new QueryParser("content", analyzer);
+ *   aqp.setAnalyzeRangeTerms(true);
+ *     
+ *   // Unicode order would include U+0633 in [ U+062F - U+0698 ], but Farsi
+ *   // orders the U+0698 character before the U+0633 character, so the single
+ *   // indexed Term above should NOT be returned by a ConstantScoreRangeQuery
+ *   // with a Farsi Collator (or an Arabic one for the case when Farsi is not
+ *   // supported).
+ *   ScoreDoc[] result
+ *     = is.search(aqp.parse("[ \u062F TO \u0698 ]"), null, 1000).scoreDocs;
+ *   assertEquals("The index Term should not be included.", 0, result.length);
+ * </pre>
+ * 
+ * <h3>Danish Sorting</h3>
+ * <pre class="prettyprint">
+ *   Analyzer analyzer 
+ *     = new CollationKeyAnalyzer(Collator.getInstance(new Locale("da", "dk")));
+ *   RAMDirectory indexStore = new RAMDirectory();

+ * 
+ * <h2>Caveats and Comparisons</h2>
+ * <p>
+ *   <strong>WARNING:</strong> Make sure you use exactly the same 
+ *   <code>Collator</code> at index and query time -- <code>CollationKey</code>s
+ *   are only comparable when produced by
+ *   the same <code>Collator</code>.  Since {@link java.text.RuleBasedCollator}s
+ *   are not independently versioned, it is unsafe to search against stored
+ *   <code>CollationKey</code>s unless the following are exactly the same (best 
+ *   practice is to store this information with the index and check that they
+ *   remain the same at query time):
+ * </p>
+ * <ol>
+ *   <li>JVM vendor</li>
+ *   <li>JVM version, including patch version</li>
+ *   <li>
+ *     The language (and country and variant, if specified) of the Locale
+ *     used when constructing the collator via
+ *     {@link java.text.Collator#getInstance(java.util.Locale)}.
+ *   </li>
+ *   <li>
+ *     The collation strength used - see {@link java.text.Collator#setStrength(int)}
+ *   </li>
+ * </ol> 
+ * <p>
+ *   <code>ICUCollationKeyAnalyzer</code>, available in the <a href="{@docRoot}/../analyzers-icu/overview-summary.html">icu analysis module</a>,
+ *   uses ICU4J's <code>Collator</code>, which 
+ *   makes its version available, thus allowing collation to be versioned
+ *   independently from the JVM.  <code>ICUCollationKeyAnalyzer</code> is also 
+ *   significantly faster and generates significantly shorter keys than 
+ *   <code>CollationKeyAnalyzer</code>.  See
+ *   <a href="http://site.icu-project.org/charts/collation-icu4j-sun"
+ *     >http://site.icu-project.org/charts/collation-icu4j-sun</a> for key
+ *   generation timing and key length comparisons between ICU4J and
+ *   <code>java.text.Collator</code> over several languages.
+ * </p>
+ * <p>
+ *   <code>CollationKey</code>s generated by <code>java.text.Collator</code>s are 
+ *   not compatible with those those generated by ICU Collators.  Specifically, if
+ *   you use <code>CollationKeyAnalyzer</code> to generate index terms, do not use
+ *   <code>ICUCollationKeyAnalyzer</code> on the query side, or vice versa.
+ * </p>

-  <title>Lucene Collation Package</title>
-</head>
-<body>
-<p>
-  Unicode collation support.
-  <code>Collation</code>
-  converts each token into its binary <code>CollationKey</code> using the 
-  provided <code>Collator</code>, allowing it to be stored as an index term.
-</p>
-
-<h2>Use Cases</h2>
-
-<ul>
-  <li>
-    Efficient sorting of terms in languages that use non-Unicode character 
-    orderings.  (Lucene Sort using a Locale can be very slow.) 
-  </li>
-  <li>
-    Efficient range queries over fields that contain terms in languages that 
-    use non-Unicode character orderings.  (Range queries using a Locale can be
-    very slow.)
-  </li>
-  <li>
-    Effective Locale-specific normalization (case differences, diacritics, etc.).
-    ({@link org.apache.lucene.analysis.core.LowerCaseFilter} and 
-    {@link org.apache.lucene.analysis.miscellaneous.ASCIIFoldingFilter} provide these services
-    in a generic way that doesn't take into account locale-specific needs.)
-  </li>
-</ul>
-
-<h2>Example Usages</h2>
-
-<h3>Farsi Range Queries</h3>
-<pre class="prettyprint">
-  // "fa" Locale is not supported by Sun JDK 1.4 or 1.5
-  Collator collator = Collator.getInstance(new Locale("ar"));
-  CollationKeyAnalyzer analyzer = new CollationKeyAnalyzer(version, collator);
-  RAMDirectory ramDir = new RAMDirectory();
-  IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(ramDir, new IndexWriterConfig(version, analyzer));
-  Document doc = new Document();
-  doc.add(new TextField("content", "\u0633\u0627\u0628", Field.Store.YES));
-  writer.addDocument(doc);
-  writer.close();
-  IndexReader ir = DirectoryReader.open(ramDir);
-  IndexSearcher is = new IndexSearcher(ir);
-
-  QueryParser aqp = new QueryParser(version, "content", analyzer);
-  aqp.setAnalyzeRangeTerms(true);
-    
-  // Unicode order would include U+0633 in [ U+062F - U+0698 ], but Farsi
-  // orders the U+0698 character before the U+0633 character, so the single
-  // indexed Term above should NOT be returned by a ConstantScoreRangeQuery
-  // with a Farsi Collator (or an Arabic one for the case when Farsi is not
-  // supported).
-  ScoreDoc[] result
-    = is.search(aqp.parse("[ \u062F TO \u0698 ]"), null, 1000).scoreDocs;
-  assertEquals("The index Term should not be included.", 0, result.length);
-</pre>
-
-<h3>Danish Sorting</h3>
-<pre class="prettyprint">
-  Analyzer analyzer 
-    = new CollationKeyAnalyzer(version, Collator.getInstance(new Locale("da", "dk")));
-  RAMDirectory indexStore = new RAMDirectory();
-  IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(indexStore, new IndexWriterConfig(version, analyzer));
-  String[] tracer = new String[] { "A", "B", "C", "D", "E" };
-  String[] data = new String[] { "HAT", "HUT", "H\u00C5T", "H\u00D8T", "HOT" };
-  String[] sortedTracerOrder = new String[] { "A", "E", "B", "D", "C" };
-  for (int i = 0 ; i < data.length ; ++i) {
-    Document doc = new Document();
-    doc.add(new StoredField("tracer", tracer[i]));
-    doc.add(new TextField("contents", data[i], Field.Store.NO));
-    writer.addDocument(doc);
-  }
-  writer.close();
-  IndexReader ir = DirectoryReader.open(indexStore);
-  IndexSearcher searcher = new IndexSearcher(ir);
-  Sort sort = new Sort();
-  sort.setSort(new SortField("contents", SortField.STRING));
-  Query query = new MatchAllDocsQuery();
-  ScoreDoc[] result = searcher.search(query, null, 1000, sort).scoreDocs;
-  for (int i = 0 ; i < result.length ; ++i) {
-    Document doc = searcher.doc(result[i].doc);
-    assertEquals(sortedTracerOrder[i], doc.getValues("tracer")[0]);
-  }
-</pre>
-
-<h3>Turkish Case Normalization</h3>
-<pre class="prettyprint">
-  Collator collator = Collator.getInstance(new Locale("tr", "TR"));
-  collator.setStrength(Collator.PRIMARY);
-  Analyzer analyzer = new CollationKeyAnalyzer(version, collator);
-  RAMDirectory ramDir = new RAMDirectory();
-  IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(ramDir, new IndexWriterConfig(version, analyzer));
-  Document doc = new Document();
-  doc.add(new TextField("contents", "DIGY", Field.Store.NO));
-  writer.addDocument(doc);
-  writer.close();
-  IndexReader ir = DirectoryReader.open(ramDir);
-  IndexSearcher is = new IndexSearcher(ir);
-  QueryParser parser = new QueryParser(version, "contents", analyzer);
-  Query query = parser.parse("d\u0131gy");   // U+0131: dotless i
-  ScoreDoc[] result = is.search(query, null, 1000).scoreDocs;
-  assertEquals("The index Term should be included.", 1, result.length);
-</pre>
-
-<h2>Caveats and Comparisons</h2>
-<p>
-  <strong>WARNING:</strong> Make sure you use exactly the same 
-  <code>Collator</code> at index and query time -- <code>CollationKey</code>s
-  are only comparable when produced by
-  the same <code>Collator</code>.  Since {@link java.text.RuleBasedCollator}s
-  are not independently versioned, it is unsafe to search against stored
-  <code>CollationKey</code>s unless the following are exactly the same (best 
-  practice is to store this information with the index and check that they
-  remain the same at query time):
-</p>
-<ol>
-  <li>JVM vendor</li>
-  <li>JVM version, including patch version</li>
-  <li>
-    The language (and country and variant, if specified) of the Locale
-    used when constructing the collator via
-    {@link java.text.Collator#getInstance(java.util.Locale)}.
-  </li>
-  <li>
-    The collation strength used - see {@link java.text.Collator#setStrength(int)}
-  </li>
-</ol> 
-<p>
-  <code>ICUCollationKeyAnalyzer</code>, available in the <a href="{@docRoot}/../analyzers-icu/overview-summary.html">icu analysis module</a>,
-  uses ICU4J's <code>Collator</code>, which 
-  makes its version available, thus allowing collation to be versioned
-  independently from the JVM.  <code>ICUCollationKeyAnalyzer</code> is also 
-  significantly faster and generates significantly shorter keys than 
-  <code>CollationKeyAnalyzer</code>.  See
-  <a href="http://site.icu-project.org/charts/collation-icu4j-sun"
-    >http://site.icu-project.org/charts/collation-icu4j-sun</a> for key
-  generation timing and key length comparisons between ICU4J and
-  <code>java.text.Collator</code> over several languages.
-</p>
-<p>
-  <code>CollationKey</code>s generated by <code>java.text.Collator</code>s are 
-  not compatible with those those generated by ICU Collators.  Specifically, if
-  you use <code>CollationKeyAnalyzer</code> to generate index terms, do not use
-  <code>ICUCollationKeyAnalyzer</code> on the query side, or vice versa.
