+======================= Lucene 3.6.2 =======================
+
+Bug Fixes
+
+* LUCENE-4234: Exception when FacetsCollector is used with ScoreFacetRequest,
+  and the number of matching documents is too large. (Gilad Barkai via Shai Erera)
+
+* LUCENE-2686, LUCENE-3505, LUCENE-4401: Fix BooleanQuery scorers to
+  return correct freq().
+  (Koji Sekiguchi, Mike McCandless, Liu Chao, Robert Muir)
+
+* LUCENE-2501: Fixed rare thread-safety issue that could cause
+  ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException inside ByteBlockPool (Robert Muir,
+  Mike McCandless)
+
+* LUCENE-4297: BooleanScorer2 would multiply the coord() factor
+  twice for conjunctions: for most users this is no problem, but
+  if you had a customized Similarity that returned something other
+  than 1 when overlap == maxOverlap (always the case for conjunctions),
+  then the score would be incorrect.  (Pascal Chollet, Robert Muir)
+
+* LUCENE-4300: BooleanQuery's rewrite was not always safe: if you
+  had a custom Similarity where coord(1,1) != 1F, then the rewritten
+  query would be scored differently.  (Robert Muir)
+
+* LUCENE-4398: If you index many different field names in your
+  documents then due to a bug in how it measures its RAM
+  usage, IndexWriter would flush each segment too early eventually
+  reaching the point where it flushes after every doc.  (Tim Smith via
+  Mike McCandless)
+
+* LUCENE-4411: when sampling is enabled for a FacetRequest, its depth
+  parameter is reset to the default (1), even if set otherwise.
+  (Gilad Barkai via Shai Erera)
+
+* LUCENE-4635: Fixed ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when in-memory
+  terms index requires more than 2.1 GB RAM (indices with billions of
+  terms).  (Tom Burton-West via Mike McCandless)
+
+Documentation
+
+* LUCENE-4302: Fix facet userguide to have HTML loose doctype like
+  all other javadocs.  (Karl Nicholas via Uwe Schindler)
