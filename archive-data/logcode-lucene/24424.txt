+- Modify top-level build.xml to build contrib area.
+
+- Implement javadoc w/ groups
+
+- Add download of dependencies
+
+- Add conditional hooks to allow build to succeed even without 3rd party dependencies
+
+- migrate other sandbox pieces over to contrib
+
+---------------------------
+
+Notes from e-mail thread:
+Here's my proposal:
+  1. Move sandbox/contributions to src/contrib;
+  2. Change build.xml to build, test & package sandbox packages too.
+  3. Change sandbox build.xml's to build in a top-level build/contrib directory, and package into a top-level dist/contrib directory, so that no files are written in src/contrib.
+
+Once this is done, then:
+
+ "ant compile" will compile all core and contributed code, building something like:
+
+    build/
+      classes/  -- core classes
+      contrib/
+        highlighter/ -- highlighter classes
+        ...
+
+ "ant test" will test all core and contributed code
+
+ "ant dist" will create something like:
+
+      dist/
+        lucene-XX.tar.gz
+        lucene-src-XX.tar.gz
+        lucene-XX.zip
+        lucene-src-XX.zip
+        contrib/
+          highligher-XX.tar.gz
+          ...
+
+And so on.
+
+
+Also, we should combine the javadoc into a single tree, with a "Core" group followed by a "Contrib" group:
+
+http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/tooldocs/solaris/javadoc.html#group
+
+As an example, Nutch does this for "Core" and "Plugin":
