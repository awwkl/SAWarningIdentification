+* LUCENE-2663: IndexWriter no longer forcefully clears any existing
+  locks when create=true.  This was a holdover from when
+  SimpleFSLockFactory was the default locking implementation, and,
+  even then it was dangerous since it could mask bugs in IndexWriter's
+  usage, allowing applications to accidentally open two writers on the
+  same directory.  (Mike McCandless)
