-#       in conjunction with Solr.  When a database is added, lib/tasks/clear_database_prerequisites.rake should be removed.
-
-# MySQL (default setup).  Versions 4.1 and 5.0 are recommended.
-#
-# Install the MySQL driver:
-#   gem install mysql
-# On MacOS X:
-#   gem install mysql -- --include=/usr/local/lib
-# On Windows:
-#   gem install mysql
-#       Choose the win32 build.
-#       Install MySQL and put its /bin directory on your path.
-#
-# And be sure to use new-style password hashing:
-#   http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/old-client.html
-development:
-  adapter: mysql
-  database: flare_development
-  username: root
-  password:
-  host: localhost
-
-# Warning: The database defined as 'test' will be erased and
-# re-generated from your development database when you run 'rake'.
-# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
-test:

-# You may specify the path to the FastCGI crash log (a log of unhandled
-# exceptions which forced the FastCGI instance to exit, great for debugging)
-# and the number of requests to process before running garbage collection.
-#
-# By default, the FastCGI crash log is RAILS_ROOT/log/fastcgi.crash.log
-# and the GC period is nil (turned off).  A reasonable number of requests
-# could range from 10-100 depending on the memory footprint of your app.
-#
-# Example:
-#   # Default log path, normal GC behavior.
-#   RailsFCGIHandler.process!
-#
-#   # Default log path, 50 requests between GC.
-#   RailsFCGIHandler.process! nil, 50
-#
-#   # Custom log path, normal GC behavior.

-// Autocompleter.Base handles all the autocompletion functionality 
-// that's independent of the data source for autocompletion. This
-// includes drawing the autocompletion menu, observing keyboard
-// and mouse events, and similar.
-//
-// Specific autocompleters need to provide, at the very least, 
-// a getUpdatedChoices function that will be invoked every time
-// the text inside the monitored textbox changes. This method 
-// should get the text for which to provide autocompletion by
-// invoking this.getToken(), NOT by directly accessing
-// this.element.value. This is to allow incremental tokenized
-// autocompletion. Specific auto-completion logic (AJAX, etc)
-// belongs in getUpdatedChoices.
-//
-// Tokenized incremental autocompletion is enabled automatically
-// when an autocompleter is instantiated with the 'tokens' option
-// in the options parameter, e.g.:
-// new Ajax.Autocompleter('id','upd', '/url/', { tokens: ',' });
-// will incrementally autocomplete with a comma as the token.
-// Additionally, ',' in the above example can be replaced with
-// a token array, e.g. { tokens: [',', '\n'] } which
-// enables autocompletion on multiple tokens. This is most 
-// useful when one of the tokens is \n (a newline), as it 
-// allows smart autocompletion after linebreaks.

-// The local array autocompleter. Used when you'd prefer to
-// inject an array of autocompletion options into the page, rather
-// than sending out Ajax queries, which can be quite slow sometimes.
-//
-// The constructor takes four parameters. The first two are, as usual,
-// the id of the monitored textbox, and id of the autocompletion menu.
-// The third is the array you want to autocomplete from, and the fourth
-// is the options block.
-//
-// Extra local autocompletion options:
-// - choices - How many autocompletion choices to offer
-//
-// - partialSearch - If false, the autocompleter will match entered
-//                    text only at the beginning of strings in the 
-//                    autocomplete array. Defaults to true, which will
-//                    match text at the beginning of any *word* in the
-//                    strings in the autocomplete array. If you want to
-//                    search anywhere in the string, additionally set
-//                    the option fullSearch to true (default: off).
-//
-// - fullSsearch - Search anywhere in autocomplete array strings.
-//
-// - partialChars - How many characters to enter before triggering
-//                   a partial match (unlike minChars, which defines
-//                   how many characters are required to do any match
-//                   at all). Defaults to 2.
-//
-// - ignoreCase - Whether to ignore case when autocompleting.
-//                 Defaults to true.
-//
-// It's possible to pass in a custom function as the 'selector' 
-// option, if you prefer to write your own autocompletion logic.
-// In that case, the other options above will not apply unless
-// you support them.

-= 1.2.0 - MASSIVE INTERNAL REFACTORING
-
-
-* !!!Support for Rails < 1.2 has been dropped!!!; if you are using Rails =< 1.1.6, please use Engines 1.1.6, available from http://svn.rails-engines.org/engines/tags/rel_1.1.6
-
-* Engines are dead! Long live plugins! There is now no meaningful notion of an engine - all plugins can take advantage of the more powerful features that the engines plugin provides by including app directories, etc.
-
-* Init_engine.rb is no longer used; please use the plugin-standard init.rb instead.
-
-* Engines.start is no longer required; please use the config.plugins array provided by Rails instead
-
-* To get the most benefit from Engines, set config.plugins to ["engines", "*"] to load the engines plugin first, and then all other plugins in their normal order after.
-
-* Access all loaded plugins via the new Rails.plugins array, and by name using Rails.plugins[:plugin_name].
-
-* Access plugin metadata loaded automatically from about.yml: Rails.plugins[:name].about. Plugin#version is provided directly, for easy access.
-
-* Module.config is has been removed - use mattr_accessor instead, and initialize your default values via the init.rb mechanism.
-
-* Public asset helpers have been rewritten; instead of engine_stylesheet, now use stylesheet_link_tag :name, :plugin => "plugin_name"
-
-* Plugin migrations have been reworked to integrate into the main migration stream. Please run script/generate plugin_migration to create plugin migrations in your main application.
-
-* The fixture method for loading fixtures against any class has been removed; instead, engines will now provide a mechanism for loading fixtures from all plugins, by mirroring fixtures into a common location.
-
-* All references to engines have been removed; For example, any rake tasks which applied to engines now apply to all plugins. The default Rails rake tasks for plugins are overridden where necessary.
-
-* Layouts can now be shared via plugins - inspiration gratefully taken from PluginAWeek's plugin_routing :)
-
-* Actual routing from plugins is now possible, by including routes.rb in your plugin directory and using the from_plugin method in config/routes.rb (Ticket #182)
-
-* Controllers are no longer loaded twice if they're not present in the normal app/ directory (Ticket #177)
-
-* The preferred location for javascripts/stylesheets/etc is now 'assets' rather than 'public'
-
-* Ensure that plugins started before routing have their controllers appropriately added to config.controller_paths (Ticket #258)
-
-* Removed Engines.version - it's not longer relevant, now we're loading version information from about.yml files.
-
-* Added a huge amount of documentation to all new modules.
-
-* Added new warning message if installation of engines 1.2.x is attempted in a Rails 1.1.x application
-
-* Added details of the removal of the config method to UPGRADING
-
-* Removed the plugins:info rake task in favour of adding information to script/about via the Rails::Info module (Ticket #261)
-
-* Improved handling of testing and documentation tasks for plugins
-
-
-
-= 1.1.4
-
-* Fixed creation of multipart emails (Ticket #190)
-
-* Added a temporary fix to the code-mixing issue. In your engine's test/test_helper.rb, please add the following lines:
-
-   # Ensure that the code mixing and view loading from the application is disabled
-   Engines.disable_app_views_loading = true
-   Engines.disable_app_code_mixing = true
-
-  which will prevent code mixing for controllers and helpers, and loading views from the application. One thing to remember is to load any controllers/helpers using 'require_or_load' in your tests, to ensure that the engine behaviour is respected (Ticket #135)
-
-* Added tasks to easily test engines individually (Ticket #120)
-
-* Fixture extensions will now fail with an exception if the corresponding class cannot be loaded (Ticket #138)
-
-* Patch for new routing/controller loading in Rails 1.1.6. The routing code is now replaced with the contents of config.controller_paths, along with controller paths from any started engines (Ticket #196)
-
-* Rails' Configuration instance is now stored, and available from all engines and plugins.
-
-
-
-= 1.1.3
-
-* Fixed README to show 'models' rather than 'model' class (Ticket #167)
-* Fixed dependency loading to work with Rails 1.1.4 (Ticket #180)
-
-
-
-= 1.1.2
-
-* Added better fix to version checking (Ticket #130, jdell@gbdev.com).
-
-* Fixed generated init_engine.rb so that VERSION module doesn't cause probems (Ticket #131, japgolly@gmail.com)
-
-* Fixed error with Rails 1.0 when trying to ignore the engine_schema_info table (Ticket #132, snowblink@gmail.com)
-
-* Re-added old style rake tasks (Ticket #133)
-
-* No longer adding all subdirectories of <engine>/app or <engine>/lib, as this can cause issues when files are grouped in modules (Ticket #149, kasatani@gmail.com)
-
-* Fixed engine precidence ordering for Rails 1.1 (Ticket #146)
-
-* Added new Engines.each method to assist in processing the engines in the desired order (Ticket #146)
-
-* Fixed annoying error message at appears when starting the console in development mode (Ticket #134)
-
-* Engines is now super-careful about loading the correct version of Rails from vendor (Ticket #154)
-
-
-
-= 1.1.1
-
-* Fixed migration rake task failing when given a specific version (Ticket #115)
-
-* Added new rake task "test:engines" which will test engines (and other plugins) but ensure that the test database is cloned from development beforehand (Ticket #125)
-
-* Fixed issue where 'engine_schema_info' table was included in schema dumps (Ticket #87)
-
-* Fixed multi-part emails (Ticket #121)
-
-* Added an 'install.rb' file to new engines created by the bundled generator, which installs the engines plugin automatically if it doesn't already exist (Ticket #122)
-
-* Added a default VERSION module to generated engines (Ticket #123)
-
-* Refactored copying of engine's public files to a method of an Engine instance. You can now call Engines.get(:engine_name).copy_public_files (Ticket #108)
-
-* Changed engine generator templates from .rb files to .erb files (Ticket #106)
-
-* Fixed the test_helper.erb file to use the correct testing extensions and not load any schema - the schema will be cloned automatically via rake test:engines
-
-* Fixed problem when running with Rails 1.1.1 where version wasn't determined correctly (Ticket #129)
-
-* Fixed bug preventing engines from loading when both Rails 1.1.0 and 1.1.1 gems are installed and in use.
-
-* Updated version (d'oh!)
-
-
-
-= 1.1.0
-
-* Improved regexp matching for Rails 1.0 engines with peculiar paths
-
-* Engine instance objects can be accessed via Engines[:name], an alias for Engines.get(:name) (Ticket #99)
-
-* init_engine.rb is now processed as the final step in the Engine.start process, so it can access files within the lib directory, which is now in the $LOAD_PATH at that point. (Ticket #99)
-
-* Clarified MIT license (Ticket #98)
-
-* Updated Rake tasks to integrate smoothly with Rails 1.1 namespaces
-
-* Changed the version to "1.1.0 (svn)"
-
-* Added more information about using the plugin with Edge Rails to the README
-
-* moved extensions into lib/engines/ directory to enable use of Engines module in extension code.
-
-* Added conditional require_or_load method which attempts to detect the current Rails version. To use the Edge Rails version of the loading mechanism, add the line:
-
-*   Engines.config :edge, true
-
-* to your environment.rb file.
-
-* Merged changes from /branches/edge and /branches/rb_1.0 into /trunk
-
-* engine_schema_info now respects the prefix/suffixes set for ActiveRecord::Base (Ticket #67)
-
-* added ActiveRecord::Base.wrapped_table_name(name) method to assist in determining the correct table name
-
-
-
-= 1.0.6
-
-* Added ability to determine version information for engines: rake engine_info
-
-* Added a custom logger for the Engines module, to stop pollution of the Rails logs.
-
-* Added some more tests (in particular, see rails_engines/applications/engines_test).
-
-* Another attempt at solving Ticket #53 - controllers and helpers should now be loadable from modules, and if a full path (including RAILS_ROOT/ENGINES_ROOT) is given, it should be safely stripped from the require filename such that corresponding files can be located in any active engines. In other words, controller/helper overloading should now completely work, even if the controllers/helpers are in modules.
-
-* Added (finally) patch from Ticket #22 - ActionMailer helpers should now load
-
-* Removed support for Engines.start :engine, :engine_name => 'whatever'. It was pointless.
-
-* Fixed engine name referencing; engine_stylesheet/engine_javascript can now happily use shorthand engine names (i.e. :test == :test_engine) (Ticket #45)
-
-* Fixed minor documentation error ('Engine.start' ==> 'Engines.start') (Ticket #57)
-
-* Fixed double inclusion of RAILS_ROOT in engine_migrate rake task (Ticket #61)
-
-* Added ability to force config values even if given as a hash (Ticket #62)
-
-
-
-= 1.0.5
-
-* Fixed bug stopping fixtures from loading with PostgreSQL
-
-
-
-= 1.0.4
-
-* Another attempt at loading controllers within modules (Ticket #56)
-
-
-
-= 1.0.3
-
-* Fixed serious dependency bug stopping controllers being loaded (Ticket #56)
-
-
-
-= 1.0.2
-
-* Fixed bug with overloading controllers in modules from /app directory
-
-* Fixed exception thrown when public files couldn't be created; exception is now logged (Ticket #52)
-
-* Fixed problem with generated test_helper.rb file via File.expand_path (Ticket #50)
-
-
-
-= 1.0.1
-
-* Added engine generator for creation of new engines
-
-* Fixed 'Engine' typo in README
-
-* Fixed bug in fixtures extensions
-
-* Fixed /lib path management bug
-
-* Added method to determine public directory location from Engine object
-

-
-* Added proper component loading
-
-* Added preliminary tests for the config() methods module
-
-
-
-= pre-v170
-
-* Fixed copyright notices to point to DHH, rather than me.
-
-* Moved extension require statements into lib/engines.rb, so the will be loaded if another module/file calls require 'engines

-The engines plugin enhances Rails' own plugin framework, making it simple to share controllers, helpers, models, public assets, routes and migrations in plugins.
-
-For more information, see http://rails-engines.org
-
-= Using the plugin
-
-With engines 1.2, no extra configuration in environment.rb is required. Having the plugin installed will automatically enable sharing of code within <tt>plugin/app/</tt> directories. Developers should be aware that the <tt>config.plugins</tt> parameter can be used to control plugin load order, if this is important for your application.
-
-=== config.plugins
-
-With Rails 1.2, the <tt>config.plugins</tt> list can be used to specify the order in which plugins are loaded. It's recommended (although not required) that you load the engines plugin first, and any other plugins later. The engines plugin enhances Rails' processing of <tt>config.plugins</tt> for occasions where you only care about the order of a small selection of your application's plugins. For instance, if you want to load +engines+ first, and anything else afterwards, then
-
-  config.plugins = ["engines", "*"]
-  
-will ensure that engines is loaded first, and everything else (in whatever order Rails chooses) afterwards.
-
-== Better plugins
-
-In addition to the regular set of plugin-supported files (lib, init.rb, tasks, generators, tests), plugins can carry the following when the engines plugin is also installed.
-
-
-=== Controllers, Helpers, and Views
-
-Include these files in an <tt>app</tt> directory just like you would in a normal Rails application. If you need to override a method, view or partial, create the corresponding file in your main <tt>app</tt> directory and it will be used instead.
-
-* Controllers & Helpers: See Engines::RailsExtensions::Dependencies for more information.
-* Views: See Engines::RailsExtensions::Templates for more information.
-
-=== Models
-
-Model code can similarly be placed in an <tt>app/models/</tt> directory. Unfortunately, it's not possible to automatically override methods within a model; if your application needs to change the way a model behaves, consider creating a subclass, or replacing the model entirely within your application's <tt>app/models/</tt> directory. See Engines::RailsExtensions::Dependencies for more information.
-
-IMPORTANT NOTE: when you load code from within plugins, it is typically not handled well by Rails in terms of unloading and reloading changes. Look here for more information - http://rails-engines.org/development/common-issues-when-overloading-code-from-plugins/
-
-=== Routes
-
-Include your route declarations in a <tt>routes.rb</tt> file at the root of your plugins, e.g.:
-
-  connect "/my/url", :controller => "some_controller"
-  my_named_route "do_stuff", :controller => "blah", :action => "stuff"
-  # etc.
-  
-You can then load these files into your application by declaring their inclusion in the application's <tt>config/routes.rb</tt>:
-
-  map.from_plugin :plugin_name
-
-See Engines::RailsExtensions::Routing for more information.
-  
-=== Migrations
-
-Migrations record the changes in your database as your application evolves. With engines 1.2, migrations from plugins can also join in this evolution as first-class entities. To add migrations to a plugin, include a <tt>db/migrate/</tt> folder and add migrations there as normal. These migrations can then be integrated into the main flow of database evolution by running the plugin_migration generator:
-
-  script/generate plugin_migration
-  
-This will produce a migration in your application. Running this migration (via <tt>rake db:migrate</tt>, as normal) will migrate the database according to the latest migrations in each plugin. See Engines::RailsExtensions::Migrations for more information.
-
-
-=== More powerful Rake tasks
-
-The engines plugin enhances and adds to the suite of default rake tasks for working with plugins. The <tt>doc:plugins</tt> task now includes controllers, helpers and models under <tt>app</tt>, and anything other code found under the plugin's <tt>code_paths</tt> attribute. New testing tasks have been added to run unit, functional and integration tests from plugins, whilst making it easier to load fixtures from plugins. See Engines::Testing for more details about testing, and run
-
-  rake -T
-  
-to see the set of rake tasks available.

-= Upgrading from Engines 1.1.x to Engines 1.2.x
-
-
-The 1.2 release of the engines plugin represents a significant rewrite of the internals. Now less intrusive into the core frameworks, it's even simpler for plugin developers to make more flexible plugins than Rails typically allows.
-
-However, as a consequence of change, you may need to make some adjustments to your application to get the most benefit. These are outlined below:
-
-
-== In your application
-
-The following changes will affect code in applications which use the engines plugin
-
-=== Change the engine_schema table to plugin_schema
-
-Because the engines plugin now works universally for any Rails plugin, the table used to store migration information has been renamed appropriately. We can also play nicely with other plugin_migration implementations by supporting this convention.
-
-
-=== Rename RAILS_ROOT/public/engine_files to RAILS_ROOT/public/plugin_assets
-
-Similarly, any plugin can now share stylesheets, images and so on via an assets folder, so the destination within the main public directory has been renamed to reflect this. You can simply delete the RAILS_ROOT/public/engine_files directory; the new one will be generated the next time your application starts.
-
-
-=== The engine_image, engine_stylesheet and engine_javascript helpers have been replaced with enhanced versions of the normal Rails asset helpers
-
-Now, it's simple to include an image from any plugin, by adding a plugin key to the helper's options hash:
-
-  image_tag "image.png", :plugin => "my_plugin"
-
-A similar convention exists for stylesheets and javascript files. Additionally, the old behaviour of automatically including assets which match the "engine"'s name has been dropped - only the files you explicitly request are included.
-
-
-=== Engines.start is replaced with config.plugins
-
-Rails' native configuration object now includes an array for specifying which plugins are loaded, and in what order. The engines plugin enhances this feature with a "*" wildcard, so that you can load any order-sensitive plugins, and then the rest in any order.
-
-  config.plugins = ["engines", "some_plugin", "another_plugin", "*"]
-  
-It's worth noting that the engines plugin no longer needs to be specifically loaded first, so most people can happily ignore the config.plugins array without any problems.
-
-
-=== The "config" method for "engine"-style configuration is no longer loaded by default. 
-
-See below.
-  
-  
-=== Any "engines" type rake tasks are now "plugin" tasks.
-
-The following rake tasks are now provided by the engines plugin for operating on your application's plugins (whenever a task can operate on a single plugin, this can be controlled by specifying PLUGIN=<name> on the commandline):
-  
-  db:fixtures:plugins:load  # load fixtures from plugins. 
-  
-  test:plugins:units        # Run tests from within <plugins>/test/units
-  test:plugins:functional   # Run tests from within <plugins>/test/functional
-  test:plugins:integration  # Run tests from within <plugins>/test/integration
-  test:plugins              # Run all tests from within <plugins>/test/*
-
-  doc:plugins               # Run full rdoc against all source files within all plugins
-  doc:plugins:<plugin>      # Run full rdoc against all source files within the given plugin
-
-
-
-== In your "engine"-style plugins
-
-If you have developed or are using plugins that leverage engines enhancements, you need to be aware of the following changes in engines 1.2.
-
-=== init_engine.rb is no longer required
-
-Please now create init.rb files, just as you'd find in "normal" plugins. Remember - there's no such thing as "an engine" anymore.
-
-
-=== The "fixture" method for loading tests from arbitrary files
-
-Supporting this was just too difficult, and it seems like the combination of Rails' own lack of enhancements regarding this feature, along with the mind-shift against static fixtures, meant that it simply was too much work to continue to support.
-
-The only reason this mechanism originally existed was to support plugins which couldn't predict the names of the tables that models might be stored in. This is now a discouraged behaviour.
-
-
-=== Engines.current.version has changed its behaviour slightly.
-
-The engines plugin used to provide a simple way to store version information about plugins. This has now been superceded by including that information in an about.yml file, which any plugin can use.
-
-
-=== The "config" method is not included, by default.
-
-Where previously developers could use the "config" method to define configuration, this is now deprecated in favour of using mattr_accessor directly in the Module. However, if you still *need* to use the config method, it is included but must be explicitly required, probably near the top of environment.rb:
-  
-  require File.join(RAILS_ROOT, "vendor", "plugins", "engines",
-                    "lib", "engines", "deprecated_config_support")
-
-
-=== Public assets should now be stored in a subdirectory of your plugin called "assets", rather than "public".
-
-This clarifies the nature of this directory; it is not made public itself, but rather is a container for files which should be made accessible from the web.

-Description:
-  The plugin migration generator assists in working with schema additions 
-  required by plugins. Instead of running migrations from plugins directly,
-  the generator creates a regular Rails migration which will be responsible
-  for migrating the plugins from their current version to the latest version
-  installed.
-  
-  This is important because the set of application migrations remains an
-  accurate record of the state of the database, even as plugins are installed
-  and removed during the development process.
-
-Example:
-  ./script/generate plugin_migration [<plugin_name> <another_plugin_name> ...]
-
-  This will generate:
-
-    RAILS_ROOT
-      |- db
-          |-migrate
-              |- xxx_plugin_migrations.rb
-
-  which contains the migrations for the given plugin(s).
-  
-  
-Advanced Usage:
-
-There may be situations where you need *complete* control over the migrations
-of plugins in your application, migrating a certainly plugin down to X, and
-another plugin up to Y, where neither X or Y are the latest migrations for those
-plugins.
-
-For those unfortunate few, I have two pieces of advice:
-
- 1. Why? This is a code smell [http://c2.com/xp/CodeSmell.html].
- 
- 2. Well, OK. Don't panic. You can completely control plugin migrations by
-    creating your own migrations. To manually migrate a plugin to a specific
-    version, simply use
-    
-      Rails.plugins[:your_plugin_name].migrate(version)
-      
-    where version is the integer of the migration this plugin should end
-    up at.
-    
-With great power comes great responsibility. Use this wisely.

-# This file contains the Engines module, which holds most of the logic regarding

-# The engines plugin adds to Rails' existing behaviour by producing the +Rails.plugins+
-# PluginList, a list of all loaded plugins in a form which can be easily queried
-# and manipulated. Each instance of Plugin has methods which are used to enhance

-#
-# = init.rb
-# 
-# When the engines plugin loads, it first includes the 
-# Engines::RailsExtensions::RailsInitializer module into Rails::Initializer,
-# overriding a number of the methods used to load plugins.
-#
-# Once this is loaded, Engines.init is called to prepare the application
-# and create the relevant new datastructures (including <tt>Rails.plugins</tt>).
-#
-# Finally, each of the extension modules from Engines::RailsExtensionsis 
-# loaded and included into the relevant Rails classes and modules, enhancing 
-# their behaviour to work better with files from plugins.
-
-require "engines/plugin_list"
-require "engines/plugin"
-
-# TODO: define a better logger.
-def logger
-  RAILS_DEFAULT_LOGGER
-end
-
-# The Engines module contains most of the methods used during the enhanced
-# startup of Rails plugins.
-#
-# When the Engines plugin loads (its <tt>init.rb</tt> file is evaluated), the
-# Engines.init method is called. This kickstarts the plugins hooks into 
-# the initialization process.
-#
-# == Parameters
-#
-# The Engines module has a number of public configuration parameters:
-#
-# [+public_directory+]  The directory into which plugin assets should be
-#                       mirrored. Defaults to <tt>RAILS_ROOT/public/plugin_assets</tt>.
-# [+schema_info_table+] The table to use when storing plugin migration 
-#                       version information. Defaults to +plugin_schema_info+.
-# [+rails_initializer+] A reference of the Rails initializer instance that
-#                       was used to startup Rails. This is often useful
-#                       when working with the startup process; see
-#                       Engines::RailsExtensions::RailsInitializer for more
-#                       information
-#
-# Additionally, there are a few flags which control the behaviour of
-# some of the features the engines plugin adds to Rails:
-#
-# [+disable_application_view_loading+] A boolean flag determining whether
-#                                      or not views should be loaded from 
-#                                      the main <tt>app/views</tt> directory.
-#                                      Defaults to false; probably only 
-#                                      useful when testing your plugin.
-# [+disable_application_code_loading+] A boolean flag determining whether
-#                                      or not to load controllers/helpers 
-#                                      from the main +app+ directory,
-#                                      if corresponding code exists within 
-#                                      a plugin. Defaults to false; again, 
-#                                      probably only useful when testing 
-#                                      your plugin.
-# [+disable_code_mixing+] A boolean flag indicating whether all plugin
-#                         copies of a particular controller/helper should 
-#                         be loaded and allowed to override each other, 
-#                         or if the first matching file should be loaded

-  #
-  #  module MyModule

-  #     => "some value"
-  #   MyModule::CONFIG[:param_two]

-# One of the magic features that that engines plugin provides is the ability to
-# override selected methods in controllers and helpers from your application.
-# This is achieved by trapping requests to load those files, and then mixing in
-# code from plugins (in the order the plugins were loaded) before finally loading
-# any versions from the main +app+ directory.
-#
-# The behaviour of this extension is output to the log file for help when
-# debugging.
-#
-# == Example
-#
-# A plugin contains the following controller in <tt>plugin/app/controllers/my_controller.rb</tt>:
-#
-#   class MyController < ApplicationController
-#     def index
-#       @name = "HAL 9000"
-#     end
-#     def list
-#       @robots = Robot.find(:all)
-#     end
-#   end
-#
-# In one application that uses this plugin, we decide that the name used in the
-# index action should be "Robbie", not "HAL 9000". To override this single method,
-# we create the corresponding controller in our application 
-# (<tt>RAILS_ROOT/app/controllers/my_controller.rb</tt>), and redefine the method:
-#
-#   class MyController < ApplicationController
-#     def index
-#       @name = "Robbie"
-#     end
-#   end
-#
-# The list method remains as it was defined in the plugin controller.
-#
-# The same basic principle applies to helpers, and also views and partials (although
-# view overriding is performed in Engines::RailsExtensions::Templates; see that
-# module for more information).
-#
-# === What about models?
-#
-# Unfortunately, it's not possible to provide this kind of magic for models.
-# The only reason why it's possible for controllers and helpers is because
-# they can be recognised by their filenames ("whatever_controller", "jazz_helper"),
-# whereas models appear the same as any other typical Ruby library ("node",
-# "user", "image", etc.). 
-#
-# If mixing were allowed in models, it would mean code mixing for *every* 
-# file that was loaded via +require_or_load+, and this could result in
-# problems where, for example, a Node model might start to include 
-# functionality from another file called "node" somewhere else in the
-# <tt>$LOAD_PATH</tt>.
-#
-# One way to overcome this is to provide model functionality as a module in
-# a plugin, which developers can then include into their own model
-# implementations.
-#
-# Another option is to provide an abstract model (see the ActiveRecord::Base
-# documentation) and have developers subclass this model in their own
-# application if they must.
-#
-# ---
-#
-# The Engines::RailsExtensions::Dependencies module includes a method to
-# override Dependencies.require_or_load, which is called to load code needed
-# by Rails as it encounters constants that aren't defined.
-#
-# This method is enhanced with the code-mixing features described above.

-
-# = Plugins and Migrations: Background
-#
-# Rails uses migrations to describe changes to the databases as your application
-# evolves. Each change to your application - adding and removing models, most
-# commonly - might require tweaks to your schema in the form of new tables, or new
-# columns on existing tables, or possibly the removal of tables or columns. Migrations
-# can even include arbitrary code to *transform* data as the underlying schema
-# changes.
-# 
-# The point is that at any particular stage in your application's development, 
-# migrations serve to transform the database into a state where it is compatible
-# and appropriate at that time.
-# 
-# == What about plugins?
-# 
-# If you want to share models using plugins, chances are that you might also
-# want to include the corresponding migrations to create tables for those models.
-# With the engines plugin installed, plugins can carry migration data easily:
-# 
-#   vendor/
-#     |
-#     plugins/
-#       |
-#       my_plugin/
-#         |- init.rb
-#         |- lib/
-#         |- db/
-#             |-migrate/
-#                 |- 001_do_something.rb
-#                 |- 002_and_something_else.rb
-#                 |- ...
-# 
-# When you install a plugin which contains migrations, you are undertaking a
-# further step in the development of your application, the same as the addition
-# of any other code. With this in mind, you may want to 'roll back' the
-# installation of this plugin at some point, and the database should be able
-# to migrate back to the point without this plugin in it too.
-#
-# == An example
-#
-# For example, our current application is at version 14 (according to the
-# +schema_info+ table), when we decide that we want to add a tagging plugin. The
-# tagging plugin chosen includes migrations to create the tables it requires
-# (say, _tags_ and _taggings_, for instance), along with the models and helpers
-# one might expect.
-#
-# After installing this plugin, these tables should be created in our database.
-# Rather than running the migrations directly from the plugin, they should be
-# integrated into our main migration stream in order to accurately reflect the
-# state of our application's database *at this moment in time*.
-#
-#   $ script/generate plugin_migration
-#         exists  db/migrate
-#         create  db/migrate/015_migrate_tagging_plugin_to_version_3.rb
-#
-# This migration will take our application to version 15, and contains the following, 
-# typical migration code:
-# 
-#   class MigrateTaggingPluginToVersion3 < ActiveRecord::Migration
-#     def self.up
-#       Rails.plugins[:tagging].migrate(3)
-#     end
-#     def self.down
-#       Rails.plugins[:tagging].migrate(0)
-#     end
-#   end
-#
-# When we migrate our application up, using <tt>rake db:migrate</tt> as normal,
-# the plugin will be migrated up to its latest version (3 in this example). If we
-# ever decide to migrate the application back to the state it was in at version 14,
-# the plugin migrations will be taken back down to version 0 (which, typically,
-# would remove all tables the plugin migrations define).
-#
-# == Upgrading plugins
-#
-# It might happen that later in an application's life, we update to a new version of
-# the tagging plugin which requires some changes to our database. The tagging plugin
-# provides these changes in the form of its own migrations. 
-#
-# In this case, we just need to re-run the plugin_migration generator to create a 
-# new migration from the current revision to the newest one:
-#
-#   $ script/generate plugin_migration
-#        exists db/migrate
-#        create db/migrate/023_migrate_tagging_plugin_to_version_5.rb
-#
-# The contents of this migration are:
-#
-#   class MigrateTaggingPluginToVersion3 < ActiveRecord::Migration
-#     def self.up
-#       Rails.plugins[:tagging].migrate(5)
-#     end
-#     def self.down
-#       Rails.plugins[:tagging].migrate(3)
-#     end
-#   end
-#
-# Notice that if we were to migrate down to revision 22 or lower, the tagging plugin
-# will be migrated back down to version 3 - the version we were previously at.
-#
-#
-# = Creating migrations in plugins
-#
-# In order to use the plugin migration functionality that engines provides, a plugin 
-# only needs to provide regular migrations in a <tt>db/migrate</tt> folder within it.
-#
-# = Explicitly migrating plugins
-#
-# It's possible to migrate plugins within your own migrations, or any other code.
-# Simply get the Plugin instance, and its Plugin#migrate method with the version
-# you wish to end up at:
-#
-#   Rails.plugins[:whatever].migrate(version)

-# == Using plugin assets in views
-#
-# It's also simple to use Rails' helpers in your views to use plugin assets.

-# For example, it's easy to use plugin assets in your layouts:

-#   <%= javascript_include_tag "my_functions", :plugin => "my_plugin" %>

-#   <%= image_tag "my_face", :plugin => "my_plugin" %>
-#   <!-- or -->
-#   <%= image_path "my_face", :plugin => "my_plugin" %>

-# Where the default helpers allow the specification of more than one file (i.e. the
-# javascript and stylesheet helpers), you can do similarly for multiple assets from 
-# within a single plugin.
-#
-# ---

-# This module enhances four of the methods from ActionView::Helpers::AssetTagHelper:

-# Effective use of Rails' routes can help create a tidy and elegant set of URLs,
-# and is a significant part of creating an external API for your web application.
-# 
-# When developing plugins which contain controllers, it seems obvious that including
-# the corresponding routes would be extremely useful. This is particularly true
-# when exposing RESTful resources using the new REST-ian features of Rails 1.2.
-#
-# == Including routes in your plugin
-#
-# The engines plugin makes it possible to include a set of routes within your plugin
-# very simply, as it turns out. In your plugin, you simply include a <tt>routes.rb</tt> 
-# file like the one below at the root of your plugin:
-# 
-#   connect "/login", :controller => "my_plugin/account", :action => "login"
-#
-#   # add a named route
-#   logout "/logout", :controller => "my_plugin/account", :action => "logout"
-#
-#   # some restful stuff
-#   resources :things do |t|
-#     t.resources :other_things
-#   end
-# 
-# Everywhere in a normal <tt>RAILS_ROOT/config/routes.rb</tt> file 
-# where you might have <tt>map.connect</tt>, you just use <tt>connect</tt> in your 
-# plugin's <tt>routes.rb</tt>.
-# 
-# === Hooking it up in your application
-#
-# While it would be possible to have each plugin's routes automagically included into
-# the application's route set, to do so would actually be a stunningly bad idea. Route
-# priority is the key issue here. You, the application developer, needs to be in complete
-# control when it comes to specifying the priority of routes in your application, since 
-# the ordering of your routes directly affects how Rails will interpret incoming requests.
-# 
-# To add plugin routes into your application's <tt>routes.rb</tt> file, you need to explicitly 
-# map them in using the Engines::RailsExtensions::Routing#from_plugin method:
-# 
-#   ApplicationController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|
-#
-#     map.connect "/app_stuff", :controller => "application_thing" # etc...
-#
-#     # This line includes the routes from the given plugin at this point, giving you
-#     # control over the priority of your application routes 
-#     map.from_plugin :your_plugin
-#
-#     map.connect ":controller/:action/:id"
-#   end
-# 
-# By including routes in plugins which have controllers, you can now share in a simple way 
-# a compact and elegant URL scheme which corresponds to those controllers.
-#
-# ---
-#
-# The Engines::RailsExtensions::Routing module defines extensions to Rails' 
-# routing (ActionController::Routing) mechanism such that routes can be loaded 
-# from a given plugin.
-#
-# The key method is Engines::RailsExtensions::Routing#from_plugin, which can be called 
-# within your application's <tt>config/routes.rb</tt> file to load plugin routes at that point.

-
-# In most cases, Rails' own plugin testing mechanisms are sufficient. However, there
-# are cases where plugins can be given a helping hand in the testing arena. This module 
-# contains some methods to assist when testing plugins that contain fixtures.
-# 
-# == Fixtures and plugins
-#
-# Since Rails' own fixtures method is fairly strict about where files can be loaded from,
-# the simplest approach when running plugin tests with fixtures is to simply copy all
-# fixtures into a single temporary location and inform the standard Rails mechanism to
-# use this directory, rather than RAILS_ROOT/test/fixtures.
-#
-# The Engines::Testing#setup_plugin_fixtures method does this, copying all plugin fixtures
-# into the temporary location before and tests are performed. This behaviour is invoked
-# the the rake tasks provided by the Engines plugin, in the "test:plugins" namespace. If
-# necessary, you can invoke the task manually.
-#
-# If you wish to take advantage of this, add a call to the Engines::Testing.set_fixture_path
-# method somewhere before your tests (in a test_helper file, or above the TestCase itself).
-#
-# = Testing plugins
-#
-# Normally testing a plugin will require that Rails is loaded, unless you are including
-# a skeleton Rails environment or set of mocks within your plugin tests. If you require
-# the Rails environment to be started, you must ensure that this actually happens; while
-# it's not obvious, your tests do not automatically run with Rails loaded.
-#
-# The simplest way to setup plugin tests is to include a test helper with the following
-# contents:
-#
-#   # Load the normal Rails helper. This ensures the environment is loaded
-#   require File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../../../../test/test_helper')
-#   # Ensure that we are using the temporary fixture path
-#   Engines::Testing.set_fixture_path
-#
-# Then run tests using the provided tasks (<tt>test:plugins</tt>, or the tasks that the engines
-# plugin provides - <tt>test:plugins:units</tt>, etc.).
-#
-# Alternatively, you can explicitly load the environment by adpating the contents of the
-# default <tt>test_helper</tt>:
-#
-#   ENV["RAILS_ENV"] = "test"
-#   # Note that we are requiring config/environment from the root of the enclosing application.
-#   require File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__) + "/../../../../config/environment")

-  
-  # Copies fixtures from plugins and the application into a temporary directory 
-  # (Engines::Testing.temporary_fixtures_directory). 
-  # 
-  # If a set of plugins is not given, fixtures are copied from all plugins in order

-
-      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
-      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
-      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
-      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
-      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

-      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
-      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
-      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
-      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
-      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
-      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
-      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
-      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
-      as of the date such litigation is filed.
-
-   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
-      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
-      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
-      meet the following conditions:
-
-      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
-          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

-      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
-          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
-          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
-          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
-          the Derivative Works; and
-
-      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
-          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
-          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
-          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
-          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
-          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
-          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
-          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
-          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
-          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
-          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
-          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
-          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
-          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
-          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
-          as modifying the License.
-
-      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
-      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
-      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
-      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
-      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
-      the conditions stated in this License.
-
-   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
-      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
-      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
-      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
-      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
-      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
-      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
-
-   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
-      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
-      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
-      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
-
-   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
-      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
-      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
-      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
-      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
-      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
-      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
-      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
-      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
-
-   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
-      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
-      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
-      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
-      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
-      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
-      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
-      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
-      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
-      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
-      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
-
-   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
-      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
-      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
-      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
-      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
-      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
-      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
-      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
-      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
-      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
-
-   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Directed by Rob Cohen, Dragon traces Bruce Lee's slow rise over myriad obstacles--most of them race-based--to become an international superstar in films. Lee's origins are oddly set in San Francisco instead of his real home in Seattle, but then again there is plenty of artistic license going on as Cohen explores the actor's psyche through some powerful fantasy sequences. Lauren Holly is good as Lee's wife, Linda (whose book about her late husband inspired this movie). A scene involving Bruce's rescue of son Brandon (who died in a filmmaking accident in 1993) from a murderous spirit is plain spooky. The special-edition DVD release has a widescreen presentation, director interview, featurette, screen tests, closed captioning, optional French soundtrack, and optional Spanish subtitles. --Tom Keogh		Universal Studios	01-07-1998		07-02-2007																			Aki Aleong/ Eric Bruskotter/ John Cheung/ Chao Li Chi/ Sam Hau/ Lauren Holly/ Clyde Kusatsu/ Nancy Kwan/ Michael Learned/ Jason Scott Lee/ Kay Tong Lim/ Sterling Macer Jr./ Iain M.

Yes, Getting Things Done offers a complete system for downloading all those free-floating gotta-do's clogging your brain into a sophisticated framework of files and action lists--all purportedly to free your mind to focus on whatever you're working on. However, it still operates from the decidedly Western notion that if we could just get really, really organized, we could turn ourselves into 24//7 productivity machines. (To wit, Allen, whom the New Economy bible Fast Company has dubbed "the personal productivity guru," suggests that instead of meditating on crouching tigers and hidden dragons while you wait for a plane, you should unsheathe that high-tech saber known as the cell phone and attack that list of calls you need to return.)/ As whole-life-organizing systems go, Allen's is pretty good, even fun and therapeutic. It starts with the exhortation to take every unaccounted-for scrap of paper in your workstation that you can't junk, The next step is to write down every unaccounted-for gotta-do cramming your head onto its own scrap of paper. Finally, throw the whole stew into a giant "in-basket"/ That's where the processing and prioritizing begin; in Allen's system, it get a little convoluted at times, rife as it is with fancy terms, subterms, and sub-subterms for even the simplest concepts. Thank goodness the spine of his system is captured on a straightforward, one-page flowchart that you can pin over your desk and repeatedly consult without having to refer back to the book. That alone is worth the purchase price. Also of value is Allen's ingenious Two-Minute Rule: if there's anything you absolutely must do that you can do right now in two minutes or less, then do it now, thus freeing up your time and mind tenfold over the long term. It's commonsense advice so obvious that most of us completely overlook it, much to our detriment; Allen excels at dispensing such wisdom in this useful, if somewhat belabored, self-improver aimed at everyone from CEOs to soccer moms (who we all know are more organized than most CEOs to start with). --Timothy Murphy/ 		Penguin (Non-Classics)	31-12-2002		03-02-2007															David Allen		267

Although XP presents a methodology for faster software development, many developers find that XP does not allow for modeling time, which is critical to ensure that a project meets its proposed requirements. They have also found that standard modeling techniques that use the Unified Modeling Language (UML) often do not work with this methodology. In this innovative book, Software Development columnist Scott Ambler presents Agile Modeling (AM)-a technique that he created for modeling XP projects using pieces of the UML and Rational's Unified Process (RUP). Ambler clearly explains AM, and shows readers how to incorporate AM, UML, and RUP into their development projects with the help of numerous case studies integrated throughout the book./  &#x2022; AM was created by the author for modeling XP projects-an element lacking in the original XP design/  &#x2022; The XP community and its creator have embraced AM, which should give this book strong market acceptance/ Companion Web site at www.agilemodeling.com features updates, links to XP and AM resources, and ongoing case studies about agile modeling./ 		John Wiley & Sons	01-02-2001		07-02-2007															Scott W.

A Semantic Web Primer provides an introduction and guide to this emerging field, describing its key ideas, languages, and technologies. Suitable for use as a textbook or for self-study by professionals, it concentrates on undergraduate-level fundamental concepts and techniques that will enable readers to proceed with building applications on their own. It includes exercises, project descriptions, and annotated references to relevant online materials. A Semantic Web Primer is the only available book on the Semantic Web to include a systematic treatment of the different languages (XML, RDF, OWL, and rules) and technologies (explicit metadata, ontologies, and logic and inference) that are central to Semantic Web development. The book also examines such crucial related topics as ontology engineering and application scenarios./ / After an introductory chapter, topics covered in succeeding chapters include XML and related technologies that support semantic interoperability; RDF and RDF Schema, the standard data model for machine-processable semantics; and OWL, the W3C-approved standard for a Web ontology language more extensive than RDF Schema; rules, both monotonic and nonmonotonic, in the framework of the Semantic Web; selected application domains and how the Semantic Web would benefit them; the development of ontology-based systems; and current debates on key issues and predictions for the future.

Ordinary art means something like: all art not made by Mozart. After all, art is rarely made by Mozart-like people; essentially-statistically speaking-there aren't any people like that. Geniuses get made once-a-century or so, yet good art gets made all the time, so to equate the making of art with the workings of genius removes this intimately human activity to a strangely unreachable and unknowable place. For all practical purposes making art can be examined in great detail without ever getting entangled in the very remote problems of genius."&#x2028;--from the Introduction/ Art & Fear explores the way art gets made, the reasons it often doesn't get made, and the nature of the difficulties that cause so many artists to give up along the way. The book's co-authors, David Bayles and Ted Orland, are themselves both working artists, grappling daily with the problems of making art in the real world. Their insights and observations, drawn from personal experience, provide an incisive view into the world of art as it is expeienced by artmakers themselves./ This is not your typical self-help book. This is a book written by artists, for artists -- it's about what it feels like when artists sit down at their easel or keyboard, in their studio or performance space, trying to do the work they need to do. First published in 1994, Art & Fear quickly became an underground classic. Word-of-mouth response alone-now enhanced by internet posting-has placed it among the best-selling books on artmaking and creativity nationally./ Art & Fear has attracted a remarkably diverse audience, ranging from beginning to accomplished artists in every medium, and including an exceptional concentration among students and teachers. The original Capra Press edition of Art & Fear sold 80,000 copies./ An excerpt:/ Today, more than it was however many years ago, art is hard because you have to keep after it so consistently.

Written for IS managers, project leaders, or programmers, this guide provides a glimpse at the principles behind XP and its potential advantages for small- to mid-size software development teams./ The book intends to describe what XP is, its guiding principles, and how it works. Simply written, the book avoids case studies and concrete details in demonstrating the efficacy of XP. Instead, it demonstrates how XP relies on simplicity, unit testing, programming in pairs, communal ownership of code, and customer input on software to motivate code improvement during the development process. As the author notes, these principles are not new, but when they're combined their synergy fosters a new and arguably better way to build and maintain software. Throughout the book, the author presents and explains these principles, such as "rapid feedback" and "play to win," which form the basis of XP./ Generally speaking, XP changes the way programmers work. The book is good at delineating new roles for programmers and managers who Beck calls "coaches." The most striking characteristic of XP is that programmers work in pairs, and that testing is an intrinsic part of the coding process. In a later section, the author even shows where XP works and where it doesn't and offers suggestions for migrating teams and organizations over to the XP process./ In the afterword, the author recounts the experiences that led him to develop and refine XP, an insightful section that should inspire any organization to adopt XP. This book serves as a useful introduction to the philosophy and practice of XP for the manager or programmer who wants a potentially better way to build software. --Richard Dragan/ Topics covered: Extreme Programming (XP) software methodology, principles, XP team roles, facilities design, testing, refactoring, the XP software lifecycle, and adopting XP./ 		Addison-Wesley Professional	05-10-1999		07-02-2007															Kent Beck		224

With plenty of advice from an indisputable expert in the field, this title is sure to be an indispensable resource for anyone who wants to get more out of their code./ As a veteran developer at Sun, the author shares his considerable insight into the design choices made over the years in Sun's own Java libraries (which the author acknowledges haven't always been perfect). Based on his experience working with Sun's best minds, the author provides a compilation of 57 tips for better Java code organized by category. Many of these ideas will let you write more robust classes that better cooperate with built-in Java APIs. Many of the tips make use of software patterns and demonstrate an up-to-the-minute sense of what works best in today's design. Each tip is clearly introduced and explained with code snippets used to demonstrate each programming principle./ Early sections on creating and destroying objects show you ways to make better use of resources, including how to avoid duplicate objects. Next comes an absolutely indispensable guide to implementing "required" methods for custom classes. This material will help you write new classes that cooperate with old ones (with advice on implementing essential requirements like the equals() and hashCode() methods)./ The author has a lot to say about class design, whether using inheritance or composition. Tips on designing methods show you how to create understandable, maintainable, and robust classes that can be easily reused by others on your team. Sections on mapping C code (like structures, unions, and enumerated types) onto Java will help C programmers bring their existing skills to Sun's new language. Later sections delve into some general programming tips, like using exceptions effectively. The book closes with advice on using threads and synchronization techniques, plus some worthwhile advice on object serialization./ Whatever your level of Java knowledge, this title can make you a more effective programmer.

Mozilla is also a framework that allows developers to create cross-platform applications. This framework is made up of JavaScript, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and Mozilla's XUL (XML-based User-interface Language) as well as the Gecko rendering engine, XBL (eXtensible Binding Language), XPCOM (Mozilla's component model), and several other components. Creating Applications with Mozilla explains how applications are created with Mozilla and provides step-by-step information about how you can create your own programs using Mozilla's powerful cross-platform development framework. This book also shows examples of many different types of existing applications to demonstrate some of the possibilities of Mozilla application development. One of Mozilla's biggest advantages for a developer is that Mozilla-based applications are cross-platform, meaning programs work the same on Windows as they do on Linux or the Mac OS. Working through the book, you are introduced to the Mozilla development environment and after installing Mozilla, you quickly learn to create simple applications. After the initial satisfaction of developing your own portable applications, the book branches into topics on modular development and packaging your application. In order to build more complex applications, coverage of XUL, JavaScript, and CSS allow you to discover how to customize and build out your application shell. The second half of the book explores more advanced topics including UI enhancement, localization, and remote distribution. Mozilla 1.0 was released on June 5th, 2002, after more than four years of development as an open source project. This book has been written so that all of the information and examples will work with this release and any of the 1.0.x maintenance releases. In addition to Netscape's Mozilla-based browsers (Netscape 6.x and 7.x), the Mozilla framework has been used to create other browsers such as Galeon and Chimera, and chat clients such as ChatZilla and JabberZilla. Developers have also used Mozilla to create games, development tools, browser enhancements, as well as all sorts of other types of applications.

But the 1980's brought a revolutionary change. With the advent of improved computer power, scientists could apply complexity theory--nonlinear thinking--to scientific processes far more easily than ever before. Physicist Fritjof Capra was at the forefront of the revolution, and in The Web of Life he extended its scope by showing the impact of complexity theory on living organisms. In The Hidden Connections he breaks through another frontier, this time applying the principles of complexity theory to an analysis of the broad sphere of all human interactions./ / Capra posits that in order to sustain life in the future, the principles underlying our social institutions must be consistent with the organization that nature has evolved to sustain the "web of life." In a lucid and convincing argument, Capra explains how the theoretical ideas of science can be applied to the practical concerns of our time. Covering every aspect of human nature and society, he discusses such vital matters as the management of human organizations, the challenges and dangers of economic globalization, and the nature and the problems of biotechnology. He concludes with an authoritative, often provocative plan for designing ecologically sustainable communities and technologies as alternatives to the current economic globalization./ / A brilliant, incisive examination of the relationship between science and our social systems, The Hidden Connections will spark enormous debate in the scientific community and inspire us to think about the future of humanity in a new way.

Decades later, it still stands up to scrutiny, explicating not only Eastern philosophies but also how modern physics forces us into conceptions that have remarkable parallels. Covering over 3,000 years of widely divergent traditions across Asia, Capra can't help but blur lines in his generalizations. But the big picture is enough to see the value in them of experiential knowledge, the limits of objectivity, the absence of foundational matter, the interrelation of all things and events, and the fact that process is primary, not things. Capra finds the same notions in modern physics. Those approaching Eastern thought from a background of Western science will find reliable introductions here to Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism and learn how commonalities among these systems of thought can offer a sort of philosophical underpinning for modern science. And those approaching modern physics from a background in Eastern mysticism will find precise yet comprehensible descriptions of a Western science that may reinvigorate a hope in the positive potential of scientific knowledge. Whatever your background, The Tao of Physics is a brilliant essay on the meeting of East and West, and on the invaluable possibilities that such a union promises. --Brian Bruya		Shambhala	04-01-2000		11-02-2007															Fritjof Capra		366

In his international bestsellers The Tao of Physics and The Turning Point, he juxtaposed physics and mysticism to define a new vision of reality. In The Web of Life, Capra takes yet another giant step, setting forth a new scientific language to describe interrelationships and interdependence of psychological, biological, physical, social, and cultural phenomena--the "web of life."/ / / / During the past twenty-five years, scientists have challenged conventional views of evolution and the organization of living systems and have developed new theories with revolutionary philosophical and social implications. Fritjof Capra has been at the forefront of this revolution. In The Web of Life, Capra offers a brilliant synthesis of such recent scientific breakthroughs as the theory of complexity, Gaia theory, chaos theory, and other explanations of the properties of organisms, social systems, and ecosystems.

Clearly presented, mathematically rigorous, and yet approachable even for the math-averse, this title sets a high standard for a textbook and reference to the best algorithms for solving a wide range of computing problems./ With sample problems and mathematical proofs demonstrating the correctness of each algorithm, this book is ideal as a textbook for classroom study, but its reach doesn't end there. The authors do a fine job of explaining each algorithm. (Reference sections on basic mathematical notation will help readers bridge the gap, but it will help to have some math background to appreciate the full achievement of this handsome hardcover volume.) Every algorithm is presented in pseudo-code, which can be implemented in any computer language, including C//C++ and Java. This ecumenical approach is one of the book's strengths. When it comes to sorting and common data structures, from basic linked lists to trees (including binary trees, red-black, and B-trees), this title really shines, with clear diagrams that show algorithms in operation. Even if you just glance over the mathematical notation here, you can definitely benefit from this text in other ways./ The book moves forward with more advanced algorithms that implement strategies for solving more complicated problems (including dynamic programming techniques, greedy algorithms, and amortized analysis). Algorithms for graphing problems (used in such real-world business problems as optimizing flight schedules or flow through pipelines) come next. In each case, the authors provide the best from current research in each topic, along with sample solutions./ This text closes with a grab bag of useful algorithms including matrix operations and linear programming, evaluating polynomials, and the well-known Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) (useful in signal processing and engineering). Final sections on "NP-complete" problems, like the well-known traveling salesman problem, show off that while not all problems have a demonstrably final and best answer, algorithms that generate acceptable approximate solutions can still be used to generate useful, real-world answers./ Throughout this text, the authors anchor their discussion of algorithms with current examples drawn from molecular biology (like the Human Genome Project), business, and engineering. Each section ends with short discussions of related historical material, often discussing original research in each area of algorithms. On the whole, they argue successfully that algorithms are a "technology" just like hardware and software that can be used to write better software that does more, with better performance. Along with classic books on algorithms (like Donald Knuth's three-volume set, The Art of Computer Programming), this title sets a new standard for compiling the best research in algorithms. For any experienced developer, regardless of their chosen language, this text deserves a close look for extending the range and performance of real-world software. --Richard Dragan/ Topics covered: Overview of algorithms (including algorithms as a technology); designing and analyzing algorithms; asymptotic notation; recurrences and recursion; probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms; heapsort algorithms; priority queues; quicksort algorithms; linear time sorting (including radix and bucket sort); medians and order statistics (including minimum and maximum); introduction to data structures (stacks, queues, linked lists, and rooted trees); hash tables (including hash functions); binary search trees; red-black trees; augmenting data structures for custom applications; dynamic programming explained (including assembly-line scheduling, matrix-chain multiplication, and optimal binary search trees); greedy algorithms (including Huffman codes and task-scheduling problems); amortized analysis (the accounting and potential methods); advanced data structures (including B-trees, binomial and Fibonacci heaps, representing disjoint sets in data structures); graph algorithms (representing graphs, minimum spanning trees, single-source shortest paths, all-pairs shortest paths, and maximum flow algorithms); sorting networks; matrix operations; linear programming (standard and slack forms); polynomials and the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT); number theoretic algorithms (including greatest common divisor, modular arithmetic, the Chinese remainder theorem, RSA public-key encryption, primality testing, integer factorization); string matching; computational geometry (including finding the convex hull); NP-completeness (including sample real-world NP-complete problems and their insolvability); approximation algorithms for NP-complete problems (including the traveling salesman problem); reference sections for summations and other mathematical notation, sets, relations, functions, graphs and trees, as well as counting and probability backgrounder (plus geometric and binomial distributions)./ 		The MIT Press	01-09-2001		07-02-2007															Thomas H.

They get frustrated losing their scroll position; they get annoyed waiting for refresh; they struggle to reorient themselves on every new page. And the list goes on. With asynchronous JavaScript and XML, known as "Ajax," you can give them a better experience. Once users have experienced an Ajax interface, they hate to go back. Ajax is new way of thinking that can result in a flowing and intuitive interaction with the user./ Ajax in Action helps you implement that thinking--it explains how to distribute the application between the client and the server (hint: use a "nested MVC" design) while retaining the integrity of the system. You will learn how to ensure your app is flexible and maintainable, and how good, structured design can help avoid problems like browser incompatibilities. Along the way it helps you unlearn many old coding habits. Above all, it opens your mind to the many advantages gained by placing much of the processing in the browser.

The contrasts possible with type are treated in detail, along with their applications to the typography ofbooks, advertising, magazines, and information data. The various contending schools oftypography are discussed, copiously illustrated with the author's selection of over 150 examples of imaginative typography from many parts ot the world./ Design with Type differs from all other books on typography in that it discusses type as a design material as well as a means of communication: the premise is that if type is understood in terms of design, the user of type will be better able to work with it to achieve maximum legibility and effectiveness, as well as aesthetic pleasure. Everyone who uses type, everyone who enjoys the appearance of the printed word, will find Design with Type informative and fascinating.

Written for professionals and students with some prior programming experience, it begins by leading the programmer gently through the basics of Scheme and continues with an introduction to some of the more advanced features of the language. Many exercises are presented to help reinforce the lessons learned, and answers to the exercises are given in a new appendix. Most of the remaining chapters are dedicated to the reference material, which describes in detail the standard features of Scheme included in the Revised Report on Scheme and the ANSI//IEEE standard for Scheme./ / Numerous examples are presented throughout the introductory and reference portions of the text, and a unique set of extended example programs and applications, with additional exercises, are presented in the final chapter. Reinforcing the book's utility as a reference text are appendixes that present the formal syntax of Scheme, a summary of standard forms and procedures, and a bibliography of Scheme resources. The Scheme Programming Language stands alone as an introduction to and essential reference for Scheme programmers. It is also useful as a supplementary text for any course that uses Scheme./ / The Scheme Programming Language is illustrated by artist Jean-Pierre Hebert, who writes Scheme programs to extend his ability to create sophisticated works of digital art.

Yet enfolded in these often poetic words is a utility that involves the complex associations derived from the evolution of the Chinese language and the vast array of therapeutic nalogies found in traditional medical works./ In discussing the point names, the authors examine the meaning, context, and significance of each acupuncture point to promote understanding of the point's use in acupuncture practice. Guidelines for understanding the nature and structure of the Chinese language are offered, along with discussions of the Chinese rationale for naming points and point groupings. The reasoning for selecting the English names is offered so that readers may adapt the names for their own use. Each of the 363 points covered is listed according to the system currently used in China. Descriptions include the name in Chinese characters, in Pinyin, and in English. The classical location according to major Chinese texts, the associated point groupings, an explanation of point functions, and classical energetic associations are also noted. Further detail is provided by inclusion of channel relationships, five-phase relationships, and qi functions. Additional notes detail linguistic and practical considerations that have accrued to the point over time. Alternate names for the point are given, again in Chinese, Pinyin, and English. Indexes provide stroke order listings, point group names, and point lists for each character. A glossary of all the characters used in point names provides a definition for each Chinese character.

Due to the size of the Java 1.2 API, graphics and graphical user interface classes are now examined in a volume called Java Foundation Classes in a Nutshell, and server-side and enterprise programming are detailed in Java Enterprise in a Nutshell./ Though primarily a reference, the book starts off with a thorough, fast-paced introduction to Java, exploring all the key topics, including syntax, object-oriented programming, security, beans, and tools. These discussions are brief and very information-dense, and if you are buying this book to learn the language, you will probably be overwhelmed by the speed of this initiation./ This book intends to document quite a bit of Java, and it easily succeeds with broad coverage of Java programming in Part I, and API cataloging broken down by package in Part II. For example, discussions in Part I explain Types, Reflection, and Dynamic Loading. The handling of these topics takes a little over a page, but the book gives a useful overview with code examples that clearly illustrate the points made. It is one of the clearest and most concise treatments of these three topics available./ The chapters in Part II include an introduction, diagrams, and sections for each class in the package. The sections for each class can be very informative, as in the discussion of the Socket class in the java.net chapter, which includes how to instantiate a Socket object, getting I//O streams from the object you instantiated, and how to alter the behavior of sockets. This discussion, like most in this book, is brief, clear, and to the point./ If you are looking for a Java reference, this is a solid volume that will provide lasting value. --John Keogh/ Topics covered: Part I, "Introducing Java," provides broad coverage of Java programming topics, including data types, syntax, classes, and objects; Java file structure; inner classes; interfaces; packages; creating and initializing objects; destroying and finalizing objects; input//output; cryptography; networking; security; threads; JavaBeans; JavaDoc; and tools that come with Java 1.2 SDK./ Part II, "The Java API Quick Reference," includes chapters on the following Java packages: java.beans, java.beans.beancontext, java.io, java.lang, java.lang.ref, java.lang.reflect, java.math, java.net, java.security, java.security.acl, java.security.cert, java.security.interfaces, java.security.spec, java.text, java.util, java.util.jar, java.util.zip, javax.crypto, javax.crypto.interfaces, javax.crypto.spec, and a final chapter, which provides an index for classes, methods, and fields./ 		O'Reilly	11-02-1999		07-02-2007															David Flanagan		666

David Flanagan's approach, which combines tutorials and examples with easy-to-use syntax guides and object references, suits the typical programmer's requirements nicely. The brand-new fourth edition of Flanagan's "Rhino Book" includes coverage of JavaScript 1.5, JScript 5.5, ECMAScript 3, and the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 standard from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Interestingly, the author has shifted away from specifying--as he did in earlier editions--what browsers support each bit of the language. Rather than say Netscape 3.0 supports the Image object while Internet Explorer 3.0 does not, he specifies that JavaScript 1.1 and JScript 3.0 support Image. More usefully, he specifies the contents of independent standards like ECMAScript, which encourages scripters to write applications for these standards and browser vendors to support them. As Flanagan says, JavaScript and its related subjects are very complex in their pure forms. It's impossible to keep track of the differences among half a dozen vendors' generally similar implementations. Nonetheless, a lot of examples make reference to specific browsers' capabilities./ Though he does not cover server-side APIs, Flanagan has chosen to separate coverage of core JavaScript (all the keywords, general syntax, and utility objects like Array) from coverage of client-side JavaScript (which includes objects, like History and Event, that have to do with Web browsers and users' interactions with them. This approach makes this book useful to people using JavaScript for applications other than Web pages. By the way, the other classic JavaScript text--Danny Goodman's JavaScript Bible--isn't as current as this book, but it's still a fantastic (and perhaps somewhat more novice-friendly) guide to the JavaScript language and its capabilities. --David Wall/ Topics covered: The JavaScript language (version 1.0 through version 1.5) and its relatives, JScript and ECMAScript, as well as the W3C DOM standards they're often used to manipulate. Tutorial sections show how to program in JavaScript, while reference sections summarize syntax and options while providing copious code examples./ 		O'Reilly Media	15-12-2001		07-02-2007															David Flanagan		900

With over a hundred substantial changes to the core language, as well as numerous library and API additions, developers have a variety of new features, facilities, and techniques available. But with so many changes, where do you start? You could read through the lengthy, often boring language specification; you could wait for the latest 500 page tome on concepts and theory; you could even play around with the new JDK, hoping you figure things out--or you can get straight to work with Java 5.0 Tiger: A Developer's Notebook. This no-nonsense, down-and-dirty guide by bestselling Java authors Brett McLaughlin and David Flanagan skips all the boring prose and lecture, and jumps right into Tiger. You'll have a handle on the important new features of the language by the end of the first chapter, and be neck-deep in code before you hit the halfway point. Using the task-oriented format of this new series, you'll get complete practical coverage of generics, learn how boxing and unboxing affects your type conversions, understand the power of varargs, learn how to write enumerated types and annotations, master Java's new formatting methods and the for//in loop, and even get a grip on concurrency in the JVM. Light on theory and long on practical application, Java 5.0 Tiger: A Developer's Notebook allows you to cut to the chase, getting straight to work with Tiger's new features. The new Developer's Notebooks series from O'Reilly covers important new tools for software developers. Emphasizing example over explanation and practice over theory, they focus on learning by doing--you'll get the goods straight from the masters, in an informal and code-intensive style that suits developers. If you've been curious about Tiger, but haven't known where to start, this no-fluff, lab-style guide is the solution.

Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code shows how refactoring can make object-oriented code simpler and easier to maintain. Today refactoring requires considerable design know-how, but once tools become available, all programmers should be able to improve their code using refactoring techniques./ Besides an introduction to refactoring, this handbook provides a catalog of dozens of tips for improving code. The best thing about Refactoring is its remarkably clear presentation, along with excellent nuts-and-bolts advice, from object expert Martin Fowler. The author is also an authority on software patterns and UML, and this experience helps make this a better book, one that should be immediately accessible to any intermediate or advanced object-oriented developer. (Just like patterns, each refactoring tip is presented with a simple name, a "motivation," and examples using Java and UML.)/ Early chapters stress the importance of testing in successful refactoring. (When you improve code, you have to test to verify that it still works.) After the discussion on how to detect the "smell" of bad code, readers get to the heart of the book, its catalog of over 70 "refactorings"--tips for better and simpler class design. Each tip is illustrated with "before" and "after" code, along with an explanation. Later chapters provide a quick look at refactoring research./ Like software patterns, refactoring may be an idea whose time has come. This groundbreaking title will surely help bring refactoring to the programming mainstream. With its clear advice on a hot new topic, Refactoring is sure to be essential reading for anyone who writes or maintains object-oriented software. --Richard Dragan/ Topics Covered: Refactoring, improving software code, redesign, design tips, patterns, unit testing, refactoring research, and tools./ 		Addison-Wesley Professional	28-06-1999		07-02-2007															Martin Fowler/ Kent Beck/ John Brant/ William Opdyke/ Don Roberts		464

It is still arguably the best resource for quick, no-nonsense explanations of using UML./ The major strength of UML Distilled is its short, concise presentation of the essentials of UML and where it fits within today's software development process. The book describes all the major UML diagram types, what they're for, and the basic notation involved in creating and deciphering them. These diagrams include use cases; class and interaction diagrams; collaborations; and state, activity, and physical diagrams. The examples are always clear, and the explanations cut to the fundamental design logic./ For the second edition, the material has been reworked for use cases and activity diagrams, plus there are numerous small tweaks throughout, including the latest UML v. 1.3 standard. An appendix even traces the evolution of UML versions./ Working developers often don't have time to keep up with new innovations in software engineering.

Not content to accept the news as reported, these readers-turned-reporters are publishing in real time to a worldwide audience via the Internet. The impact of their work is just beginning to be felt by professional journalists and the newsmakers they cover. In We the Media: Grassroots Journalism by the People, for the People, nationally known business and technology columnist Dan Gillmor tells the story of this emerging phenomenon, and sheds light on this deep shift in how we make and consume the news. We the Media is essential reading for all participants in the news cycle:/  &#x2022; Consumers learn how they can become producers of the news. Gillmor lays out the tools of the grassroots journalist's trade, including personal Web journals (called weblogs or blogs), Internet chat groups, email, and cell phones. He also illustrates how, in this age of media consolidation and diminished reporting, to roll your own news, drawing from the array of sources available online and even over the phone./  &#x2022; Newsmakers politicians, business executives, celebrities get a wake-up call. The control that newsmakers enjoyed in the top-down world of Big Media is seriously undermined in the Internet Age. Gillmor shows newsmakers how to successfully play by the new rules and shift from control to engagement./  &#x2022; Journalists discover that the new grassroots journalism presents opportunity as well as challenge to their profession. One of the first mainstream journalists to have a blog, Gillmor says, "My readers know more than I do, and that's a good thing." In We the Media, he makes the case to his colleagues that, in the face of a plethora of Internet-fueled news vehicles, they must change or become irrelevant./ At its core, We the Media is a book about people. People like Glenn Reynolds, a law professor whose blog postings on the intersection of technology and liberty garnered him enough readers and influence that he became a source for professional journalists. Or Ben Chandler, whose upset Congressional victory was fueled by contributions that came in response to ads on a handful of political blogs. Or Iraqi blogger Zayed, whose Healing Irag blog (healingiraq.blogspot.com) scooped Big Media. Or acridrabbit, who inspired an online community to become investigative reporters and discover that the dying Kaycee Nichols sad tale was a hoax. Give the people tools to make the news, We the Media asserts, and they will. Journalism in the 21st century will be fundamentally different from the Big Media that prevails today. We the Media casts light on the future of journalism, and invites us all to be part of it.		O'Reilly Media	08-02-2004		11-02-2007															Dan Gillmor		304

For many of us, anatomy can seem intimidating and unrewarding, but the right teacher can clear such feelings away in a heartbeat. Our fascination with our bodies is a powerful force, and once we start looking, we find that beauty is much more than skin-deep./ It so happens that the right teacher can take the form of a book. Gray's Anatomy is one of those few titles that practically everybody has heard of, and with good reason--it is a scientific and artistic triumph. Not just a dry index of parts and names, Gray's lets the natural beauty and grace of the body's interconnected systems and structures shine forth from the page. Using sumptuous illustrations and clear, matter-of-fact descriptions, Dr. Gray unleashed a classic on the world more than 100 years ago. Its clarity and usefulness keep it in print today. Whether you want to understand yourself or others, knowledge of our physical parts and how they fit together is essential. Gray's Anatomy provides that information in a simple, timeless format that cleanly dissects a body of knowledge grown over centuries.

While the reader isn't expected to have prior expertise in XML, this book is most effective as an add-on to a more introductory tutorial because of its relatively fast pace./ The authors set out to systematically--and rapidly--cover the basics of XML first, namely the history of the markup language and the various languages and technologies that compose the standard. In this first section, they discuss the basics of XML markup, Document Type Definitions (DTDs), namespaces, and Unicode. From there, the authors move into "narrative-centric documents" in a section that appropriately focuses on the application of XML to books, articles, Web pages and other readable content./ This book definitely presupposes in the reader an aptitude for picking up concepts quickly and for rapidly building cumulative knowledge. Code examples are used--only to illustrate the particular point in question--but not in excess. The book gets into "data-centric" XML, exploring the difference between the object-driven Document Object Model (DOM) and the event-driven Simple API for XML (SAX). However, these areas are a little underpowered and offer a bit less detail about this key area than the reader will expect./ At the core of any Nutshell book is the reference section, and the installment found inside this text is no exception. Here, the XML 1.0 standard, XPath, XSLT, DOM, SAX, and character sets are covered. Some material that is covered earlier in the book--such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)--is not re-articulated, however. XML in a Nutshell is not the only book on XML you should have, but it is definitely one that no XML coder should be without. --Stephen W.

Like any other craft, computer programming has spawned a body of wisdom, most of which isn't taught at universities or in certification classes. Most programmers arrive at the so-called tricks of the trade over time, through independent experimentation. In The Pragmatic Programmer, Andrew Hunt and David Thomas codify many of the truths they've discovered during their respective careers as designers of software and writers of code./ Some of the authors' nuggets of pragmatism are concrete, and the path to their implementation is clear. They advise readers to learn one text editor, for example, and use it for everything. They also recommend the use of version-tracking software for even the smallest projects, and promote the merits of learning regular expression syntax and a text-manipulation language. Other (perhaps more valuable) advice is more light-hearted. In the debugging section, it is noted that, "if you see hoof prints think horses, not zebras." That is, suspect everything, but start looking for problems in the most obvious places. There are recommendations for making estimates of time and expense, and for integrating testing into the development process. You'll want a copy of The Pragmatic Programmer for two reasons: it displays your own accumulated wisdom more cleanly than you ever bothered to state it, and it introduces you to methods of work that you may not yet have considered. Working programmers will enjoy this book. --David Wall/ Topics covered: A useful approach to software design and construction that allows for efficient, profitable development of high-quality products. Elements of the approach include specification development, customer relations, team management, design practices, development tools, and testing procedures.

Despite it's name, unit testing is really a coding technique, not a testing technique. Unit testing is done by programmers, for programmers. It's primarily for our benefit: we get improved confidence in our code, better ability to make deadlines, less time spent in the debugger, and less time beating on the code to make it work correctly. This book shows how to write tests, but more importantly, it goes where other books fear to tread and gives you concrete advice and examples of what to test--the common things that go wrong in all of our programs. Discover the tricky hiding places where bugs breed, and how to catch them using the freely available JUnit framework. It's easy to learn how to think of all the things in your code that are likely to break. We'll show you how with helpful mnemonics, summarized in a handy tip sheet (also available from our www.pragmaticprogrammer.com website) to help you remember all this stuff.

You will learn performance tips and ways to get Servlets to work together (like forwarding and redirection), plus the basics of database programming with JDBC, to build content with "live" data. A later chapter examines what's next for Servlets with the emerging Servlet 2.3 API standard. Importantly, the authors go over deploying and configuring Web applications by editing XML files, a must-have for successfully running Servlets in real applications./ Since the first edition of this title, the choices for Java Web developers have grown much richer. Many of the new chapters in this edition look at options beyond Servlets. Short sections on application frameworks such as Tea, WebMacro, the Element Construction Set (ECS), XMLC, and JavaServer Pages (JSP) let you explore what's out there for Java developers today with a survey of some current tools that can speed up creating new Web applications./ The text closes with reference sections on Servlet APIs (and other material) that will be useful for any working developer. Although Servlets are not the only game in town, they are still important tools for successful Web development. This updated edition shows you just how to do it with plenty of basic and advanced tips for taking full advantage of this powerful Java standard. --Richard Dragan/ Topics covered:/  &#x2022; Overview and history of Java Servlets/  &#x2022; Fundamentals of HTTP/  &#x2022; Web applications (including deployment and configuration using XML files)/  &#x2022; The Servlet lifecycle (initializing, processing requests, cleanup, and caching)/  &#x2022; Multimedia content (images and compressed content)/  &#x2022; WAP and WML for wireless content/  &#x2022; Servlet session tracking techniques (hidden form fields, cookies, and URL rewriting)/  &#x2022; Security issues with Servlets (including certificates and SSL)/  &#x2022; Tutorial for JDBC and Java database programming/  &#x2022; Using applets and Servlets together/  &#x2022; Servlet collaboration/  &#x2022; Quick introduction to Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE)/  &#x2022; Internationalization issues/  &#x2022; Survey of third-party Servlet application frameworks and tools: Tea, WebMacro, the Element Contruction Set (ECS), XMLC, and JavaServer Pages (JSP)/  &#x2022; Miscellaneous tips for Servlets (including sending e-mail and using regular expressions)/  &#x2022; Description of the new Servlet 2.3 API spec/  &#x2022; Servlet API quick reference/ 		O'Reilly Media	15-01-2001		07-02-2007															Jason Hunter		753

Connect enough of them together properly, though, and you get spontaneous intelligence. Web pundit Steven Johnson explains what we know about this phenomenon with a rare lucidity in Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software. Starting with the weird behavior of the semi-colonial organisms we call slime molds, Johnson details the development of increasingly complex and familiar behavior among simple components: cells, insects, and software developers all find their place in greater schemes./ / Most game players, alas, live on something close to day-trader time, at least when they're in the middle of a game--thinking more about their next move than their next meal, and usually blissfully oblivious to the ten- or twenty-year trajectory of software development. No one wants to play with a toy that's going to be fun after a few decades of tinkering--the toys have to be engaging now, or kids will find other toys./ Johnson has a knack for explaining complicated and counterintuitive ideas cleverly without stealing the scene. Though we're far from fully understanding how complex behavior manifests from simple units and rules, our awareness that such emergence is possible is guiding research across disciplines. Readers unfamiliar with the sciences of complexity will find Emergence an excellent starting point, while those who were chaotic before it was cool will appreciate its updates and wider scope. --Rob Lightner/ 		Scribner	27-08-2002		11-02-2007															Steven Johnson		288

He reveals the results in Mind Wide Open, an engaging and personal account of his foray into edgy brain science. In the 21st century, Johnson observes, we have become used to ideas such as "adrenaline rushes" and "serotonin levels," without really recognizing that complex neurobiology has become a commonplace thing to talk about. He sees recent laboratory revelations about the brain as crucial for understanding ourselves and our psyches in new, post-Freudian ways. Readers shy about slapping electrodes on their own temples can get a vicarious scientific thrill as Johnson tries out empathy tests, neurofeedback, and fMRI scans. The results paint a distinct picture of the author, and uncover general brain secrets at the same time. Memory, fear, love, alertness--all the multitude of states housed in our brains are shown to be the results of chemical and electrical interactions constantly fed and changed by input from our senses. Mind Wide Open both satisfies curiosity and provokes more questions, leaving readers wondering about their own gray matter. --Therese Littleton		Scribner	03-05-2005		11-02-2007															Steven Johnson		288

Brand identities are even flourishing online, she notes--and for some retailers, perhaps best of all online: "Liberated from the real-world burdens of stores and product manufacturing, these brands are free to soar, less as the disseminators of goods or services than as collective hallucinations."/ In No Logo, Klein patiently demonstrates, step by step, how brands have become ubiquitous, not just in media and on the street but increasingly in the schools as well. (The controversy over advertiser-sponsored Channel One may be old hat, but many readers will be surprised to learn about ads in school lavatories and exclusive concessions in school cafeterias.) The global companies claim to support diversity, but their version of "corporate multiculturalism" is merely intended to create more buying options for consumers. When Klein talks about how easy it is for retailers like Wal-Mart and Blockbuster to "censor" the contents of videotapes and albums, she also considers the role corporate conglomeration plays in the process. How much would one expect Paramount Pictures, for example, to protest against Blockbuster's policies, given that they're both divisions of Viacom?/ Klein also looks at the workers who keep these companies running, most of whom never share in any of the great rewards. The president of Borders, when asked whether the bookstore chain could pay its clerks a "living wage," wrote that "while the concept is romantically appealing, it ignores the practicalities and realities of our business environment." Those clerks should probably just be grateful they're not stuck in an Asian sweatshop, making pennies an hour to produce Nike sneakers or other must-have fashion items. Klein also discusses at some length the tactic of hiring "permatemps" who can do most of the work and receive few, if any, benefits like health care, paid vacations, or stock options. While many workers are glad to be part of the "Free Agent Nation," observers note that, particularly in the high-tech industry, such policies make it increasingly difficult to organize workers and advocate for change./ But resistance is growing, and the backlash against the brands has set in. Street-level education programs have taught kids in the inner cities, for example, not only about Nike's abusive labor practices but about the astronomical markup in their prices. Boycotts have commenced: as one urban teen put it, "Nike, we made you. We can break you." But there's more to the revolution, as Klein optimistically recounts: "Ethical shareholders, culture jammers, street reclaimers, McUnion organizers, human-rights hacktivists, school-logo fighters and Internet corporate watchdogs are at the early stages of demanding a citizen-centered alternative to the international rule of the brands ... as global, and as capable of coordinated action, as the multinational corporations it seeks to subvert."No Logo is a comprehensive account of what the global economy has wrought and the actions taking place to thwart it. --Ron Hogan/ 		Picador	06-04-2002		11-02-2007															Naomi Klein		528

In Don't Make Me Think, author Steve Krug lightens up the subject with good humor and excellent, to-the-point examples./ The title of the book is its chief personal design premise. All of the tips, techniques, and examples presented revolve around users being able to surf merrily through a well-designed site with minimal cognitive strain. Readers will quickly come to agree with many of the book's assumptions, such as "We don't read pages--we scan them" and "We don't figure out how things work--we muddle through." Coming to grips with such hard facts sets the stage for Web design that then produces topnotch sites./ Using an attractive mix of full-color screen shots, cute cartoons and diagrams, and informative sidebars, the book keeps your attention and drives home some crucial points. Much of the content is devoted to proper use of conventions and content layout, and the "before and after" examples are superb. Topics such as the wise use of rollovers and usability testing are covered using a consistently practical approach./ This is the type of book you can blow through in a couple of evenings. But despite its conciseness, it will give you an expert's ability to judge Web design. You'll never form a first impression of a site in the same way again. --Stephen W.

While the captains of industry might dismiss it as mere science fiction, The Cluetrain Manifesto is definitely of this day and age. Aiming squarely at the solar plexus of corporate America, authors Christopher Locke, Rick Levine, Doc Searls, and David Weinberger show how the Internet is turning business upside down. They proclaim that, thanks to conversations taking place on Web sites and message boards, and in e-mail and chat rooms, employees and customers alike have found voices that undermine the traditional command-and-control hierarchy that organizes most corporate marketing groups. "Markets are conversations," the authors write, and those conversations are "getting smarter faster than most companies." In their view, the lowly customer service rep wields far more power and influence in today's marketplace than the well-oiled front office PR machine./ The Cluetrain Manifesto began as a Web site (www.cluetrain.com) in 1999 when the authors, who have worked variously at IBM, Sun Microsystems, the Linux Journal, and NPR, posted 95 theses that pronounced what they felt was the new reality of the networked marketplace. For example, thesis no. 2: "Markets consist of human beings, not demographic sectors"; thesis no. 20: "Companies need to realize their markets are often laughing. At them"; thesis no. 62: "Markets do not want to talk to flacks and hucksters. They want to participate in the conversations going on behind the corporate firewall"; thesis no. 74: "We are immune to advertising. Just forget it." The book enlarges on these themes through seven essays filled with dozens of stories and observations about how business gets done in America and how the Internet will change it all. While Cluetrain will strike many as loud and over the top, the message itself remains quite relevant and unique. This book is for anyone interested in the Internet and e-commerce, and is especially important for those businesses struggling to navigate the topography of the wired marketplace.

Chuang Tzu, who wrote in the fourth and third centuries B.C., is the chief authentic historical spokesman for Taoism and its founder Lao Tzu (a legendary character known largely through Chuang Tzu's writings). Indeed it was because of Chuang Tzu and the other Taoist sages that Indian Buddhism was transformed, in China, into the unique vehicle we now call by its Japanese name &#x2014; Zen. The Chinese sage abounds in wit, paradox, satire, and shattering insight into the true ground of being. Father Merton, no stranger to Asian thought, brings a vivid, modern idiom to the timeless wisdom of Tao. Illustrated with early Chinese drawings.

In reality, however, varying browser support for CSS1 and lack of CSS2 implementation makes CSS a very tricky topic. Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide is a comprehensive text that shows how to take advantage of the benefits of CSS while keeping compatibility issues in mind./ The book is very upfront about the spotty early browser support for CSS1 and the sluggish adoption of CSS2. However, enthusiasm for the technology spills out of the pages, making a strong case for even the most skeptical reader to give CSS a whirl and count on its future. The text covers CSS1 in impressive depth--not only the syntactical conventions but also more general concepts such as specificity and inheritance. Frequent warnings and tips alert the reader to browser-compatibility pitfalls./ Entire chapters are devoted to topics like units and values, visual formatting and positioning, and the usual text, fonts, and colors. This attention to both detail and architecture helps readers build a well-rounded knowledge of CSS and equips readers for a future of real-world debugging.

CSS allows web pages to become more structural, and at the same time promises that they can have a more sophisticated look than ever before. With good implementations in Internet Explorer 5.0 and Opera 3.6, and 100% CSS1 support expected in Netscapes's Mozilla browser, signs are that CSS is rapidly becoming a useful, reliable, and powerful tool for web authors./ The CSS Pocket Reference briefly introduces CSS and then lists all CSS1 properties, plus the CSS1 pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes. Since browser incompatibility is the biggest obstacle to CSS adoption, we've also included a comprehensive guide to how the browsers have implemented support for CSS1.

This poem of patently Indian genius sprouted an immense tree of devotional, artistic, and philosophical elaboration in the subcontinent. The scene is a battlefield with the prince Arjuna pitted against his own family, but no sooner does the poem begin than the action reverts inward. Krishna, Arjuna's avatar and spiritual guide, points the way to the supreme wisdom and perfect freedom that lie within everyone's reach. Worship and be faithful, meditate and know reality--these make up the secret of life and lead eventually to the realization that the self is the root of the world. In this titular translation, Stephen Mitchell's rhythms are faultless, making music of this ancient "Song of the Blessed One." Savor his rendition, but nibble around the edges of his introduction. In a bizarre mixture of praise and condescension, Mitchell disregards two millennia of Indian commentary, seeking illumination on the text from Daoism and Zen, with the Gita coming up just shy of full spiritual merit. Perhaps we should take it from Gandhi, who used the Gita as a handbook for life, that it nourishes on many levels. --Brian Bruya		Three Rivers Press	27-08-2002		11-02-2007															Stephen Mitchell		224

Thomas Moore, an internationally renowned theologian and former Catholic monk, offers a philosophy for living that involves accepting our humanity rather than struggling to transcend it. By nurturing the soul in everyday life, Moore shows how to cultivate dignity, peace, and depth of character. For example, in addressing the importance of daily rituals he writes, "Ritual maintains the world's holiness. As in a dream a small object may assume significance, so in a life that is animated by ritual there are no insignificant things." This is the eloquence that helped reintroduce the sacred into everyday language and contemporary values.		Harper Paperbacks	26-01-1994		03-02-2007															Thomas Moore		336

How can you filter streams of complex information to pull out only what you want? Why does it matter how information is structured when Google seems to magically bring up the right answer to your questions? What does it mean to be "findable" in this day and age? This eye-opening new book examines the convergence of information and connectivity. Written by Peter Morville, author of the groundbreaking Information Architecture for the World Wide Web, the book defines our current age as a state of unlimited findability. In other words, anyone can find anything at any time. Complete navigability./ Morville discusses the Internet, GIS, and other network technologies that are coming together to make unlimited findability possible. He explores how the melding of these innovations impacts society, since Web access is now a standard requirement for successful people and businesses. But before he does that, Morville looks back at the history of wayfinding and human evolution, suggesting that our fear of being lost has driven us to create maps, charts, and now, the mobile Internet./ The book's central thesis is that information literacy, information architecture, and usability are all critical components of this new world order. Hand in hand with that is the contention that only by planning and designing the best possible software, devices, and Internet, will we be able to maintain this connectivity in the future. Morville's book is highlighted with full color illustrations and rich examples that bring his prose to life./ Ambient Findability doesn't preach or pretend to know all the answers. Instead, it presents research, stories, and examples in support of its novel ideas. Are we truly at a critical point in our evolution where the quality of our digital networks will dictate how we behave as a species? Is findability indeed the primary key to a successful global marketplace in the 21st century and beyond. Peter Morville takes you on a thought-provoking tour of these memes and more -- ideas that will not only fascinate but will stir your creativity in practical ways that you can apply to your work immediately./ "A lively, enjoyable and informative tour of a topic that's only going to become more important."&#x2028;--David Weinberger, Author, Small Pieces Loosely Joined and The Cluetrain Manifesto/ "I envy the young scholar who finds this inventive book, by whatever strange means are necessary. The future isn't just unwritten--it's unsearched."&#x2028;--Bruce Sterling, Writer, Futurist, and Co-Founder, The Electronic Frontier Foundation/ "Search engine marketing is the hottest thing in Internet business, and deservedly so. Ambient Findability puts SEM into a broader context and provides deeper insights into human behavior. This book will help you grow your online business in a world where being found is not at all certain."&#x2028;--Jakob Nielsen, Ph.D., Author, Designing Web Usability: The Practice of Simplicity/ "Information that's hard to find will remain information that's hardly found--from one of the fathers of the discipline of information architecture, and one of its most experienced practitioners, come penetrating observations on why findability is elusive and how the act of seeking changes us."&#x2028;--Steve Papa, Founder and Chairman, Endeca/ "Whether it's a fact or a figure, a person or a place, Peter Morville knows how to make it findable. Morville explores the possibilities of a world where everything can always be found--and the challenges in getting there--in this wide-ranging, thought-provoking book."&#x2028;--Jesse James Garrett, Author, The Elements of User Experience/ "It is easy to assume that current searching of the World Wide Web is the last word in finding and using information. Peter Morville shows us that search engines are just the beginning. Skillfully weaving together information science research with his own extensive experience, he develops for the reader a feeling for the near future when information is truly findable all around us. There are immense implications, and Morville's lively and humorous writing brings them home."&#x2028;--Marcia J. Bates, Ph.D., University of California Los Angeles/ "I've always known that Peter Morville was smart. After reading Ambient Findability, I now know he's (as we say in Boston) wicked smart. This is a timely book that will have lasting effects on how we create our future.&#x2028;--Jared Spool, Founding Principal, User Interface Engineering/ "In Ambient Findability, Peter Morville has put his mind and keyboard on the pulse of the electronic noosphere. With tangible examples and lively writing, he lays out the challenges and wonders of finding our way in cyberspace, and explains the mutually dependent evolution of our changing world and selves. This is a must read for everyone and a practical guide for designers."&#x2028;--Gary Marchionini, Ph.D., University of North Carolina/ "Find this book! Anyone interested in making information easier to find, or understanding how finding and being found is changing, will find this thoroughly researched, engagingly written, literate, insightful and very, very cool book well worth their time.

Once we can identify and understand what this quality of awareness is, we have the key to self-mastery in virtually every area of our lives.According to great masters like Lao Tzu or Buddha, most of us move through our lives like sleepwalkers. Never really present in what we are doing, never fully alert to our environment, and not even aware of what motivates us to do and say the things we do.At the same time, all of us have experienced moments of awareness-or awakening, to use another-in extraordinary circumstances. On the road, in a sudden and unexpected accident, time seems to stop and one is suddenly aware of every movement, every sound, every thought. Or in moments that touch us deeply-welcoming a new baby into the world for the first time, or being with someone at the moment of death.Awareness, says Osho, is the key to being self-directed, centered, and free in every aspect of our lives. In this book, Osho teaches how to live life more attentively, mindfully, and meditatively, with love, caring and consciousness.OSHO challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to life in all its richness. He has been described by the Sunday Times of London as one of the "1000 Makers of the 20th Century" and by Sunday Mid-Day (India) as one of the ten people-along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha-who have changed the destiny of India. More than a decade after his death in 1990, the influence of his teachings continues to expand, reaching seekers of all ages in virtually every country of the world.

Leih Tzu was a well-known Taoist master in the fourth century B.C., and his sly critiques of a Confucius provide abundant opportunities for the reader to explore the contrasts between the rational and irrational, the male and female, the structured and the spontaneous."Who Is Really Happy" uses the discovery of a human skull on the roadside to probe into the question of immortality and how misery arises out of the existence of the ego."A Man Who Knows How to Console Himself" looks beneath the apparent cheerfulness of a wandering monk and asks if there is really a happiness that endures through life's ups and downs."No Regrets" is a parable about the difference between the knowledge that is gathered from the outside and the "knowing" that arises from within."No Rest for the Living" uses a dialogue between a despondent seeker and his master to reveal the limits of philosophy and the crippling consequences of living for the sake of some future goal. "Best Be Still, Best Be Empty" discusses the difference between the path of the will, the via affirmitiva of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, versus the path of the mystic, the via negativa of Buddha and Lao Tzu.A Q&A section addresses how Taoist understanding applies to everyday life in concrete, practical terms.

Most appealing and useful is the book's premise: though its subject matter can be dry, "technical writing is a creative act." Author Carol Rosenblum Perry likens the technical writer to a ceramist, recommending that he or she get as much down on paper (or computer) as possible for the first draft, then think of that "rough text as a big, shapeless lump of clay" to be sculpted. Next is a more oblique analogy to figurative drawing. Perry urges the technical writer to consider the writing's "skeleton" (order), "body mass" (conciseness), and "muscle tone" (vigor). Finally, technical writing is compared to making music: "Writing, like music, depends on its dynamics ... varying degrees of 'loudness' and 'softness.'"

Today's increasingly fast pace of software development--as programmers make small changes to software one day only to undo them the next--has only heightened the problem; consecutive work on code or single-programmer software is a rare sight these days. Without careful attention to version control, concurrent and collaborative work can create more headaches than it solves. This is where Subversion comes into play. Written by members of the Subversion open source development team, Version Control with Subversion introduces the powerful new versioning tool designed to be the successor to the Concurrent Version System or CVS. CVS users will find the "look and feel" Subversion comfortably familiar, but under the surface it's far more flexible, robust, and usable, and more importantly, it improves on CVS's more notable flaws. The book begins with a general introduction to Subversion, the basic concepts behind version control, and a guided tour of Subversion's capabilities and structure. With thorough attention to detail, the authors cover every aspect of installing and configuring Subversion for managing a programming project, documentation, or any other team-based endeavor. Later chapters cover the more complex topics of branching, repository administration, and other advanced features such as properties, externals, and access control. The book ends with reference material and appendices covering a number of useful topics such as a Subversion complete reference and troubleshooting guide. Version Control with Subversion aims to be useful to readers of widely different backgrounds, from those with no previous experience in version control to experienced sysadmins. If you've never used version control, you'll find everything you need to get started in this book. And if you're a seasoned CVS pro, this book will help you make a painless leap into Subversion.

How do we manage it--so effortlessly that we scarcely ever stop to think about it? In Words and Rules: The Ingredients of Language, a look at the simple concepts that we use to devise works as complex as love sonnets and tax laws, renowned neuroscientist and linguist Steven Pinker shows us how. The latest linguistic research suggests that each of us stores a limited (though large) number of words and word-parts in memory and manipulates them with a much smaller number of rules to produce every writing and utterance, and Pinker explains every step of the way with engaging good humor./ Pinker's enthusiasm for the subject infects the reader, particularly as he emphasizes the relation between how we communicate and how we think. What does it mean that a small child who has never heard the word wug can tell a researcher that when one wug meets another, there are two wugs? Some rule must be telling the child that English plurals end in -s, which also explains mistakes like mouses. Is our communication linked inextricably with our thinking? Pinker says yes, and it's hard to disagree. Words and Rules is an excellent introduction to and overview of current thinking about language, and will greatly reward the careful reader with new ways of thinking about how we think, talk, and write. --Rob Lightner/ 		Harper Perennial	15-01-2000		03-02-2007															Steven Pinker		368

It's also a primer on nutrition--including facts about green foods, such as spirulina and blue-green algae, and the "regeneration diets" used by cancer patients and arthritics--along with an inspiring cookbook with more than 300 mostly vegetarian, nutrient-packed recipes./ The information on Chinese medicine is useful for helping to diagnose health imbalances, especially nascent illnesses. It's smartly paired with the whole-foods program because the Chinese have attributed various health-balancing properties to foods, so you can tailor your diet to help alleviate symptoms of illness. For example, Chinese medicine dictates that someone with low energy and a pale complexion (a yin deficiency) would benefit from avoiding bitter foods and increasing "sweet" foods such as soy, black sesame seeds, parsnips, rice, and oats. (Note that the Chinese definition of sweet foods is much different from the American one!)/ Pitchford says in his dedication that he hopes the reader finds "healing, awareness, and peace" from following his program. The diet is certainly acetic by American standards (no alcohol, caffeine, white flour, fried foods, or sugar, and a minimum of eggs and dairy) but the reasons he gives for avoiding these "negative energy" foods are compelling. From the adrenal damage imparted by coffee to immune dysfunction brought on by excess refined sugar, Pitchford spurs you to rethink every dietary choice and its ultimate influence on your health. Without being alarmist, he adds dietary tips for protecting yourself against the dangers of modern life, including neutralizing damage from water fluoridation (thyroid and immune-system problems may result; fluoride is a carcinogen). There's further reading on food combining, female health, heart disease, pregnancy, fasting, and weight loss. Overall, this is a wonderful book for anyone who's serious about strengthening his or her body from the inside out. --Erica Jorgensen/ 		North Atlantic Books	12-02-2002		11-02-2007															Paul Pitchford		750

RDF provides a consistent framework and syntax for describing and querying data, making it possible to share website descriptions more easily. RDF's capabilities, however, have long been shrouded by its reputation for complexity and a difficult family of specifications. Practical RDF breaks through this reputation with immediate and solvable problems to help you understand, master, and implement RDF solutions. Practical RDF explains RDF from the ground up, providing real-world examples and descriptions of how the technology is being used in applications like Mozilla, FOAF, and Chandler, as well as infrastructure you can use to build your own applications. This book cuts to the heart of the W3C's often obscure specifications, giving you tools to apply RDF successfully in your own projects. The first part of the book focuses on the RDF specifications. After an introduction to RDF, the book covers the RDF specification documents themselves, including RDF Semantics and Concepts and Abstract Model specifications, RDF constructs, and the RDF Schema. The second section focuses on programming language support, and the tools and utilities that allow developers to review, edit, parse, store, and manipulate RDF//XML. Subsequent sections focus on RDF's data roots, programming and framework support, and practical implementation and use of RDF and RDF//XML. If you want to know how to apply RDF to information processing, Practical RDF is for you. Whether your interests lie in large-scale information aggregation and analysis or in smaller-scale projects like weblog syndication, this book will provide you with a solid foundation for working with RDF.

Just sit tight, despite the earth-shattering revelations that will have your head in your hands as you hope the words will rearrange themselves into a different story. But take one warning to heart: do not open Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince until you have first found a secluded spot, safe from curious eyes, where you can tuck in for a good long read. Because once you start, you won't stop until you reach the very last page./ A darker book than any in the series thus far with a level of sophistication belying its genre, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince moves the series into murkier waters and marks the arrival of Rowling onto the adult literary scene. While she has long been praised for her cleverness and wit, the strength of Book 6 lies in her subtle development of key characters, as well as her carefully nuanced depiction of a community at war. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, no one and nothing is safe, including preconceived notions of good and evil and of right and wrong. With each book in her increasingly remarkable series, fans have nervously watched J.K. Rowling raise the stakes; gone are the simple delights of butterbeer and enchanted candy, and days when the worst ailment could be cured by a bite of chocolate. A series that began as a colorful lark full of magic and discovery has become a dark and deadly war zone. But this should not come as a shock to loyal readers. Rowling readied fans with Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix by killing off popular characters and engaging the young students in battle. Still, there is an unexpected bleakness from the start of Book 6 that casts a mean shadow over Quidditch games, silly flirtations, and mountains of homework. Ready or not, the tremendous ending of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince will leave stunned fans wondering what great and terrible events await in Book 7 if this sinister darkness is meant to light the way. --Daphne Durham/ Visit the Harry Potter Store/ / Our Harry Potter Store features all things Harry, including books (box sets and collector's editions), audio CDs and cassettes, DVDs, soundtracks, games, and more. &#x2028;&#x2028;Begin at the Beginning/ Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone/ / Hardcover / Paperback/ Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets/ / Hardcover/ Paperback/ Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban/ / Hardcover/ Paperback/ Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire/ / Hardcover/ Paperback/ Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix/ / Hardcover/ Paperback/ &#x2028;Why We Love Harry&#x2028;Favorite Moments from the Series&#x2028;There are plenty of reasons to love Rowling's wildly popular series--no doubt you have several dozen of your own. Our list features favorite moments, characters, and artifacts from the first five books. Keep in mind that this list is by no means exhaustive (what we love about Harry could fill ten books!) and does not include any of the spectacular revelatory moments that would spoil the books for those (few) who have not read them. Enjoy./ Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone/ / * Harry's first trip to the zoo with the Dursleys, when a boa constrictor winks at him. / * When the Dursleys' house is suddenly besieged by letters for Harry from Hogwarts. Readers learn how much the Dursleys have been keeping from Harry. Rowling does a wonderful job in displaying the lengths to which Uncle Vernon will go to deny that magic exists. / * Harry's first visit to Diagon Alley with Hagrid. Full of curiosities and rich with magic and marvel, Harry's first trip includes a trip to Gringotts and Ollivanders, where Harry gets his wand (holly and phoenix feather) and discovers yet another connection to He-Who-Must-No-Be-Named. This moment is the reader's first full introduction to Rowling's world of witchcraft and wizards./ * Harry's experience with the Sorting Hat./ Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets/ / * The de-gnoming of the Weasleys' garden. Harry discovers that even wizards have chores--gnomes must be grabbed (ignoring angry protests "Gerroff me! Gerroff me!"), swung about (to make them too dizzy to come back), and tossed out of the garden--this delightful scene highlights Rowling's clever and witty genius. / * Harry's first experience with a Howler, sent to Ron by his mother. / * The Dueling Club battle between Harry and Malfoy. Gilderoy Lockhart starts the Dueling Club to help students practice spells on each other, but he is not prepared for the intensity of the animosity between Harry and Draco. Since they are still young, their minibattle is innocent enough, including tickling and dancing charms./ Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban/ / * Ron's attempt to use a telephone to call Harry at the Dursleys'. / * Harry's first encounter with a Dementor on the train (and just about any other encounter with Dementors). Harry's brush with the Dementors is terrifying and prepares Potter fans for a darker, scarier book. / * Harry, Ron, and Hermione's behavior in Professor Trelawney's Divination class. Some of the best moments in Rowling's books occur when she reminds us that the wizards-in-training at Hogwarts are, after all, just children. Clearly, even at a school of witchcraft and wizardry, classes can be boring and seem pointless to children. / * The Boggart lesson in Professor Lupin's classroom. / * Harry, Ron, and Hermione's knock-down confrontation with Snape./ Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire/ / * Hermione's disgust at the reception for the veela (Bulgarian National Team Mascots) at the Quidditch World Cup. Rowling's fourth book addresses issues about growing up--the dynamic between the boys and girls at Hogwarts starts to change. Nowhere is this more plain than the hilarious scene in which magical cheerleaders nearly convince Harry and Ron to jump from the stands to impress them. / * Viktor Krum's crush on Hermione--and Ron's objection to it. / * Malfoy's "Potter Stinks" badge. / * Hermione's creation of S.P.E.W., the intolerant bigotry of the Death Eaters, and the danger of the Triwizard Tournament. Add in the changing dynamics between girls and boys at Hogwarts, and suddenly Rowling's fourth book has a weight and seriousness not as present in early books in the series. Candy and tickle spells are left behind as the students tackle darker, more serious issues and take on larger responsibilities, including the knowledge of illegal curses./ Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix/ / / * Harry's outburst to his friends at No. 12 Grimmauld Place. A combination of frustration over being kept in the dark and fear that he will be expelled fuels much of Harry's anger, and it all comes out at once, directly aimed at Ron and Hermione. Rowling perfectly portrays Harry's frustration at being too old to shirk responsibility, but too young to be accepted as part of the fight that he knows is coming. / * Harry's detention with Professor Umbridge. Rowling shows her darker side, leading readers to believe that Hogwarts is no longer a safe haven for young wizards. Dolores represents a bureaucratic tyrant capable of real evil, and Harry is forced to endure their private battle of wills alone. / * Harry and Cho's painfully awkward interactions. Rowling clearly remembers what it was like to be a teenager. / * Harry's Occlumency lessons with Snape. / * Dumbledore's confession to Harry./ / Magic, Mystery, and Mayhem: A Conversation with J.K. Rowling&#x2028;/ / "I am an extraordinarily lucky person, doing what I love best in the world. I'm sure that I will always be a writer. It was wonderful enough just to be published.

Oliver Sacks's The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat tells the stories of individuals afflicted with fantastic perceptual and intellectual aberrations: patients who have lost their memories and with them the greater part of their pasts; who are no longer able to recognize people and common objects; who are stricken with violent tics and grimaces or who shout involuntary obscenities; whose limbs have become alien; who have been dismissed as retarded yet are gifted with uncanny artistic or mathematical talents./ If inconceivably strange, these brilliant tales remain, in Dr. Sacks's splendid and sympathetic telling, deeply human. They are studies of life struggling against incredible adversity, and they enable us to enter the world of the neurologically impaired, to imagine with our hearts what it must be to live and feel as they do. A great healer, Sacks never loses sight of medicine's ultimate responsibility: "the suffering, afflicted, fighting human subject."/ / 		Harpercollins	01-02-1987		11-02-2007															Oliver W.

The book marked a turning point in Zen literature in its critical reevaluation of the enlightenment experience, which the author believes has often been emphasized at the expense of other important aspects of Zen training. In addition, Zen Training goes beyond the first flashes of enlightenment to explore how one lives as well as trains in Zen. The author also draws many significant parallels between Zen and Western philosophy and psychology, comparing traditional Zen concepts with the theories of being and cognition of such thinkers as Heidegger and Husserl.

But if his cyberpunk classic was big, Cryptonomicon is huge... gargantuan... massive, not just in size (a hefty 918 pages including appendices) but in scope and appeal. It's the hip, readable heir to Gravity's Rainbow and the Illuminatus trilogy. And it's only the first of a proposed series--for more information, read our interview with Stephenson./ Cryptonomicon zooms all over the world, careening conspiratorially back and forth between two time periods--World War II and the present. Our 1940s heroes are the brilliant mathematician Lawrence Waterhouse, cryptanalyst extraordinaire, and gung ho, morphine-addicted marine Bobby Shaftoe. They're part of Detachment 2702, an Allied group trying to break Axis communication codes while simultaneously preventing the enemy from figuring out that their codes have been broken. Their job boils down to layer upon layer of deception. Dr. Alan Turing is also a member of 2702, and he explains the unit's strange workings to Waterhouse. "When we want to sink a convoy, we send out an observation plane first.... Of course, to observe is not its real duty--we already know exactly where the convoy is. Its real duty is to be observed.... Then, when we come round and sink them, the Germans will not find it suspicious."/ All of this secrecy resonates in the present-day story line, in which the grandchildren of the WWII heroes--inimitable programming geek Randy Waterhouse and the lovely and powerful Amy Shaftoe--team up to help create an offshore data haven in Southeast Asia and maybe uncover some gold once destined for Nazi coffers. To top off the paranoiac tone of the book, the mysterious Enoch Root, key member of Detachment 2702 and the Societas Eruditorum, pops up with an unbreakable encryption scheme left over from WWII to befuddle the 1990s protagonists with conspiratorial ties./ Cryptonomicon is vintage Stephenson from start to finish: short on plot, but long on detail so precise it's exhausting. Every page has a math problem, a quotable in-joke, an amazing idea, or a bit of sharp prose. Cryptonomicon is also packed with truly weird characters, funky tech, and crypto--all the crypto you'll ever need, in fact, not to mention all the computer jargon of the moment. A word to the wise: if you read this book in one sitting, you may die of information overload (and starvation). --Therese Littleton/ 		Harper Perennial	02-05-2000		07-02-2007															Neal Stephenson		928

All projects need version control: it's a foundational piece of any project's infrastructure. Yet half of all project teams in the U.S. don't use any version control at all. Many others don't use it well, and end up experiencing time-consuming problems. Version Control, done well, is your "undo" button for the project: nothing is final, and mistakes are easily rolled back. With version control, you'll never again lose a good idea because someone overwrote your file edits. You can always find out easily who made what changes to the source code--and why. Version control is a project-wide time machine. Dial in a date and see exactly what the entire project looked like yesterday, last Tuesday, or even last year. This book describes a practical, easy-to-follow way of using CVS, the most commonly used version control system in the world (and it's available for free). Instead of presenting the grand Theory of Version Control and describing every possible option (whether you'd ever use it or not), this book focuses on the practical application of CVS. It builds a set of examples of use that parallel the life of typical projects, showing you how to adopt and then enhance your pragmatic use of CVS. With this book, you can:/  &#x2022; Keep project all assets (not just source code) safe, and never run the risk of losing a great idea/  &#x2022; Know how to undo bad decisions--no matter when they were made/  &#x2022; Learn how to share code safely, and work in parallel for maximum efficiency/  &#x2022; See how to avoid costly code freezes/  &#x2022; Manage 3rd party code/ Now there's no excuse not to use professional-grade version control.

Or do we? A look at most neighborhood signage tells a different story. Through sloppy usage and low standards on the Internet, in e-mail, and now text messages, we have made proper punctuation an endangered species./ In Eats, Shoots & Leaves, former editor Truss dares to say, in her delightfully urbane, witty, and very English way, that it is time to look at our commas and semicolons and see them as the wonderful and necessary things they are. This is a book for people who love punctuation and get upset when it is mishandled. From the invention of the question mark in the time of Charlemagne to George Orwell shunning the semicolon, this lively history makes a powerful case for the preservation of a system of printing conventions that is much too subtle to be mucked about with.

The subject matter is Chinese medicine, making these texts ideal for those who wish to learn Chinese from real-world sources. All 128 of the texts chosen are excerpted from the introduction to Chinese medicine written by Qin Bowei, one of the founders of TCM and a medical writer known for his clear, precise and detailed clinical expression. The work is thus a superb supplement for students of Chinese and an effective course of study for clinicians or scholars who wish to read Chinese technical periodicals, papers and texts./ The first volume teaches vocabulary. Each text is an exercise; readers transliterate, then translate a passage based on the simplified character vocabulary provided with each passage and its preceding passages. A completed transliteration in Pinyin and a finished English translation accompany the Chinese. The subject matter provides an exposure to authentic contemporary discussions of the fundamental principles of Chinese medicine./ The second volume teaches analysis of Chinese texts through the principles of Natural Language development. By showing how to identify the basic statement in a sentence and the adjunct statements that complete its meaning, just as children learn to read their native language, the reader is given access to Chinese texts as quickly as is possible. When the course is completed, users are working with typical modern Chinese medical sources./ 		Paradigm Publications (MA)	09-02-1994		11-02-2007															Paul U. Unschuld		2

Many books explain the syntax and basic use of Java; however, this essential guide explains not only what you can do with the syntax, but what you ought to do. Just as Strunk and White's The Elements of Style provides rules of usage for the English language, this text furnishes a set of rules for Java practitioners. While illustrating these rules with parallel examples of correct and incorrect usage, the authors offer a collection of standards, conventions, and guidelines for writing solid Java code that will be easy to understand, maintain, and enhance. Java developers and programmers who read this book will write better Java code, and become more productive as well. Indeed, anyone who writes Java code or plans to learn how to write Java code should have this book next to his//her computer.

There is, however, a large open-source development community around this highly capable language. Java Open Source Programming describes and provides tutorials on some of the most interesting public Java projects, and is designed to enable a Java programmer (who's worked through the basic language's initial learning curve) to take on more ambitious assignments. The authors generally treat the covered open-source packages as resources to be used, rather than projects to be contributed to, and so it's fair to think of this volume as the "missing manual" for downloaded code. In that spirit, the authors devote many sections to "how to" subjects (addressing, for example, a good way to retrieve stored objects from a database and the procedure for calling an action in XWork)./ Java Open Source Programming takes a bit of a risk by devoting a lot of space to the development of a complex application (an online pet shop), as such a didactic strategy can be hard to follow. The authors pull it off, though, and manage to show that their covered technologies can be used to create a feature-rich and robust application that uses the versatile model-view-controller (MVC) pattern. This book will suit you well if you're planning an MVC Java project and want to take advantage of open-source packages. --David Wall/ Topics covered: The most popular open-source Java packages, particularly those concerned with Web applications and the model-view-controller (MVC) pattern. Specific packages covered include JUnit and Mocks (code testing), Hibernate (persistent storage of objects in databases), WebWork (MVC), SiteMesh (Web page layout), Lucene (site searching), and WebDoclet (configuration file generation)./ 		Wiley	28-11-2003		07-02-2007															Joseph Walnes/ Ara Abrahamian/ Mike Cannon-Brookes/ Patrick A.

Managing Gigabytes: Compressing and Indexing Documents and Images is a treasure trove of theory, practical illustration, and general discussion in this fascinating technical subject./ Ian Witten, Alistair Moffat, and Timothy Bell have updated their original work with this even more impressive second edition. This version adds recent techniques such as block-sorting, new indexing techniques, new lossless compression strategies, and many other elements to the mix. In short, this work is a comprehensive summary of text and image compression, indexing, and querying techniques. The history of relevant algorithm development is woven well with a practical discussion of challenges, pitfalls, and specific solutions./ This title is a textbook-style exposition on the topic, with its information organized very clearly into topics such as compression, indexing, and so forth. In addition to diagrams and example text transformations, the authors use "pseudo-code" to present algorithms in a language-independent manner wherever possible. They also supplement the reading with mg--their own implementation of the techniques. The mg C language source code is freely available on the Web./ Alone, this book is an impressive collection of information. Nevertheless, the authors list numerous titles for further reading in selected topics. Whether you're in the midst of application development and need solutions fast or are merely curious about how top-notch information management is done, this hardcover is an excellent investment. --Stephen W. Plain/ Topics covered: Text compression models, including Huffman, LZW, and their variants; trends in information management; index creation and compression; image compression; performance issues; and overall system implementation./ 		Morgan Kaufmann	15-05-1999		07-02-2007															Ian H.

But making it work for your company is far more complicated than simply installing a copy of Linux. If you are serious about using open source to cut costs, accelerate development, and reduce vendor lock-in, you must institutionalize skills and create new ways of working. You must understand how open source is different from commercial software and what responsibilities and risks it brings. Open Source for the Enterprise is a sober guide to putting open source to work in the modern IT department./ Open source software is software whose code is freely available to anyone who wants to change and redistribute it. New commercial support services, smaller licensing fees, increased collaboration, and a friendlier platform to sell products and services are just a few of the reasons open source is so attractive to IT departments. Some of the open source projects that are in current, widespread use in businesses large and small include Linux, FreeBSD, Apache, MySQL, PostgreSQL, JBOSS, and Perl. These have been used to such great effect by Google, Amazon, Yahoo!, and major commercial and financial firms, that a wave of publicity has resulted in recent years, bordering on hype. Large vendors such as IBM, Novell, and Hewlett Packard have made open source a lynchpin of their offerings. Open source has entered a new area where it is being used as a marketing device, a collaborative software development methodology, and a business model./ This book provides something far more valuable than either the cheerleading or the fear-mongering one hears about open source. The authors are Dan Woods, former CTO of TheStreet.com and a consultant and author of several books about IT, and Gautam Guliani, Director of Software Architecture at Kaplan Test Prep & Admissions. Each has used open source software for some 15 years at IT departments large and small. They have collected the wisdom of a host of experts from IT departments, open source communities, and software companies./ Open Source for the Enterprise provides a top to bottom view not only of the technology, but of the skills required to manage it and the organizational issues that must be addressed. Here are the sorts of questions answered in the book:/  &#x2022; Why is there a "productization gap" in most open source projects?/  &#x2022; How can the maturity of open source be evaluated?/  &#x2022; How can the ROI of open source be calculated?/  &#x2022; What skills are needed to use open source?/  &#x2022; What sorts of open source projects are appropriate for IT departments at the beginner, intermediate, advanced, and expert levels?/  &#x2022; What questions need to be answered by an open source strategy?/  &#x2022; What policies for governance can be instituted to control the adoption of open source?/  &#x2022; What new commercial services can help manage the risks of open source?/  &#x2022; Do differences in open source licenses matter?/  &#x2022; How will using open source transform an IT department?/ Praise for Open Source for the Enterprise: "Open Source has become a strategic business issue; decisions on how and where to choose to use Open Source now have a major impact on the overall direction of IT abilities to support the business both with capabilities and by controlling costs. This is a new game and one generally not covered in existing books on Open Source which continue to assume that the readers are 'deep dive' technologists, Open Source for the Enterprise provides everyone from business managers to technologists with the balanced view that has been missing. Well worth the time to read, and also worth encouraging others in your enterprise to read as well." ----Andy Mulholland - Global CTO Capgemini/ "Open Source for the Enterprise is required reading for anyone working with or looking to adopt open source technologies in a corporate environment. Its practical, no-BS approach will make sure you're armed with the information you need to deploy applications successfully (as well as helping you know when to say "no"). If you're trying to sell open source to management, this book will give you the ammunition you need. If you're a manager trying to drive down cost using open source, this book will tell you what questions to ask your staff. In short, it's a clear, concise explanation of how to successfully leverage open source without making the big mistakes that can get you fired." ----Kevin Bedell - founding editor of LinuxWorld Magazine/ 		O'Reilly Media	27-07-2005		08-02-2007															Dan Woods/ Gautam Guliani		217

The book contains the much needed documentation on the Cocoon project, but it does not limit itself to just being a developer's handbook. The book motivates the use of XML and XML software (in particular open source software). It contains everything a beginner needs to get going with Cocoon as well as the detailed information a developer needs to develop new and exciting components to extend the XML publishing framework. Although each chapter builds upon the previous ones, the book is designed so that the chapters can also be read as individual guides to the topics they discuss. Varied "hands-on" examples are used to make the underlying concepts and technologies absolutely clear to anyone starting out with Cocoon. Chapters that detail the author's experience in building Internet applications are used to embed Cocoon into the "real world" and complete the picture.
