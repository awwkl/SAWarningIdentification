+ * LUCENE-2060: Chagned ConcurrentMergeScheduler's default for
+   maxNumThreads from 3 to 1, because in practice we get the most
+   gains from running a single merge in the backround.  More than one
+   concurrent merge causes alot of thrashing (though it's possible on
+   SSD storage that there would be net gains).  (Jason Rutherglen,
