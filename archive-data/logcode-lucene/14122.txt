-* LUCENE-2906: Added CJKBigramFilter that forms bigrams from StandardTokenizer or
-  ICUTokenizer CJK tokens, and CJKWidthFilter that normalizes halfwidth/fullwidth. 
-  This filter supports unicode supplementary characters and you can toggle whether 
-  bigrams are formed for each of Han/Hiragana/Katakana/Hangul independently. Deprecates
-  CJKTokenizer.  (Tom Burton-West, Robert Muir)

 API Changes
 
-* LUCENE-3596: DirectoryTaxonomyWriter.openIndexWriter() now takes an 
-  openIndexWriter parameter rather than just an open-mode. (Doron Cohen) 
-  
-* LUCENE-3606: FieldNormModifier was deprecated, because IndexReader's
-  setNorm() was deprecated. Furthermore, this class is broken, as it does
-  not take position overlaps into account while recalculating norms.
