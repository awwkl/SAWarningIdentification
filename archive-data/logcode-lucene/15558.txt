+* LUCENE-3108, LUCENE-2935, LUCENE-2168, LUCENE-1231: Changes from 
+  IndexDocValues (ColumnStrideFields):
+  
+  - IndexWriter now supports typesafe dense per-document values stored in
+    a column like storage. IndexDocValues are stored on a per-document
+    basis where each documents field can hold exactly one value of a given
+    type. IndexDocValues are provided via Fieldable and can be used in
+    conjunction with stored and indexed values.
+     
+  - IndexDocValues provides an entirely RAM resident document id to value
+    mapping per field as well as a DocIdSetIterator based disk-resident
+    sequential access API relying on filesystem-caches.
+    
+  - Both APIs are exposed via IndexReader and the Codec / Flex API allowsing
+    expert users to integrate customized IndexDocValues reader and writer
+    implementations by extending existing Codecs.
+    
+  - IndexDocValues provides implementations for primitive datatypes like int,
+    long, float, double and arrays of byte. Byte based implementations further
+    provide storage variants like straight or dereferenced stored bytes, fixed
+    and variable length bytes as well as index time sorted base on user-provided
+    comparators.
