+* SOLR-2391: The preferred Content-Type for XML was changed to
+  application/xml. XMLResponseWriter now only delivers using this
+  type; updating documents and analyzing documents is still supported
+  using text/xml as Content-Type, too. If you have clients that are
+  hardcoded on text/xml as Content-Type, you have to change them.
