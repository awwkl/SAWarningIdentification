+
+This is the README file for webcrawler-LARM contribution to Lucene Sandbox.
+
+
+- This contribution requires:
+  a) HTTPClient (not Jakarta's, but this one:
+    http://www.innovation.ch/java/HTTPClient/
+b) Jakarta ORO package for regular expressions
+
+- The original archive file that I got from Clemens had ORO and
+HTTPClient in lib directory.  I don't think we should include those
+there, so I took them out.
+
+- This contribution also uses 3rd party (X?)HTML parser, which is
+included.
+  I am not sure if Clemens' modified this parser in any way.  If not,
+maybe we don't have to include it and can instead just add it to the
+list of required packages.
+
+- This code requires(?) JDK 1.4, as it uses assert keyword.
