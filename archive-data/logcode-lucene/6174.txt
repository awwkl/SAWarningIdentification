-* LUCENE-5600: HttpClientBase did not properly consume a connection if a server
-  error occurred. (Christoph Kaser via Shai Erera)
+* LUCENE-5673: MMapDirectory: Work around a "bug" in the JDK that throws
+  a confusing OutOfMemoryError wrapped inside IOException if the FileChannel
+  mapping failed because of lack of virtual address space. The IOException is
+  rethrown with more useful information about the problem, omitting the
+  incorrect OutOfMemoryError.  (Robert Muir, Uwe Schindler)
 
-* LUCENE-5559: Add additional argument validation for CapitalizationFilter
-  and CodepointCountFilter. (Ahmet Arslan via Robert Muir)

+
+* LUCENE-5622: Fail tests if they print over the given limit of bytes to 
+  System.out or System.err. (Robert Muir, Dawid Weiss)

+* LUCENE-5619: Added backwards compatibility tests to ensure we can update existing
+  indexes with doc-values updates. (Shai Erera, Robert Muir)

+* LUCENE-5635: IndexWriter didn't properly handle IOException on TokenStream.reset(),

 * LUCENE-5628: Change getFiniteStrings to iterative not recursive
   implementation, so that building suggesters on a long suggestion
   doesn't risk overflowing the stack; previously it consumed one Java
-  stack frame per character in the expanded suggestion (Robert Muir,
-  Simon Willnauer, Mike McCandless).
