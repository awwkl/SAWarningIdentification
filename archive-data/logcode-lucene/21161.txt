+
+Under no circumstances should any new files be added to this directory
+without careful consideration of how LICENSE.txt and NOTICE.txt in the
+parent directory should be updated to reflect the addition. 
+
+Even if a Jar being added is from another Apache project, it should be
+mentioned in NOTICE.txt, and may have additional Attribution or
+Licencing information that also needs to be added to the appropriate
+file.  
+
+---
+
+If an existing Jar is replaced with a newer version, the same
+consideration should be given as if it were an entirely new file:
+verify that no updates need to be made to LICENSE.txt or NOTICE.txt
+based on changes in the terms of the dependency being updated. 
+
+---
+
+Any changes made to this directory should be noted in CHANGES.txt,
+along with the specific version information.  If the version is a
+"snapshot" of another Apache project, include the SVN revision number.
+
+---
+
+When upgrading Lucene-Java Jars, remember to generate new Analysis
+factories for any new Tokenizers or TokenFilters.  See the wiki for
+details...
