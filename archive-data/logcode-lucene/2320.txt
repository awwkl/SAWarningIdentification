     We want to detect here only a limited set of versions and placed in normalized form in ${build.java.runtime},
     every other version is normalized to "unknown":
     - To define a target to be only run on a specific version, add <equals/> condition to one of the supplied versions.
-    - To explicitely exclude specific versions (and unknown ones), add a condition to disallow "unknown" and some versions like "1.9"!
+    - To explicitely exclude specific versions (and unknown ones), add a condition to disallow "unknown" and some versions like "1.9"/"9"!
+    - For Java 9, be sure to exclude both in custom checks: "9" and "1.9"
