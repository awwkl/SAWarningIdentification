+<TITLE>BAHIA COCOA REVIEW</TITLE>
+<DATELINE>    SALVADOR, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Showers continued throughout the week in
+the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early
+January and improving prospects for the coming temporao,
+although normal humidity levels have not been restored,
+Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review.
+    The dry period means the temporao will be late this year.
+    Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags
+of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93
+mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems
+that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the
+arrivals figures.
+    Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how
+much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has
+practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates
+around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there
+are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers,
+middlemen, exporters and processors.
+    There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit
+for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in
+obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.
+    In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have
+sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.
+    Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350
+cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.
+    Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and
+only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to
+1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.
+    New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with
+June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs
+under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs
+per tonne FOB.
+    Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at
+4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs.
+    April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July

+<TITLE>TALKING POINT/BANKAMERICA &lt;BAC> EQUITY OFFER</TITLE>
+<AUTHOR>    by Janie Gabbett, Reuters</AUTHOR>
+<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>BankAmerica Corp is not under
+pressure to act quickly on its proposed equity offering and
+would do well to delay it because of the stock's recent poor
+performance, banking analysts said.
+    Some analysts said they have recommended BankAmerica delay
+its up to one-billion-dlr equity offering, which has yet to be
+approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
+    BankAmerica stock fell this week, along with other banking
+issues, on the news that Brazil has suspended interest payments
+on a large portion of its foreign debt.
+    The stock traded around 12, down 1/8, this afternoon,
+after falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news.
+    Banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of the
+First Interstate Bancorp &lt;I> takeover bid gone, BankAmerica is
+under no pressure to sell the securities into a market that
+will be nervous on bank stocks in the near term.
+    BankAmerica filed the offer on January 26. It was seen as
+one of the major factors leading the First Interstate
+withdrawing its takeover bid on February 9.
+    A BankAmerica spokesman said SEC approval is taking longer
+than expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated.
+    "The circumstances at the time will determine what we do,"
+said Arthur Miller, BankAmerica's Vice President for Financial
+Communications, when asked if BankAmerica would proceed with
+the offer immediately after it receives SEC approval.
+    "I'd put it off as long as they conceivably could," said
+Lawrence Cohn, analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
+Smith.
+    Cohn said the longer BankAmerica waits, the longer they
+have to show the market an improved financial outlook.
+    Although BankAmerica has yet to specify the types of
+equities it would offer, most analysts believed a convertible
+preferred stock would encompass at least part of it.
+    Such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean a
+lower conversion price and more dilution to BankAmerica stock
+holders, noted Daniel Williams, analyst with Sutro Group.
+    Several analysts said that while they believe the Brazilian
+debt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry
+through the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely to
+ease over the coming weeks.
+    Nevertheless, BankAmerica, which holds about 2.70 billion
+dlrs in Brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the
+interest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mln
+dlrs if Brazil pays no interest for a year, said Joseph
+Arsenio, analyst with Birr, Wilson and Co.
+    He noted, however, that any potential losses would not show
+up in the current quarter.
+    With other major banks standing to lose even more than
+BankAmerica if Brazil fails to service its debt, the analysts
+said they expect the debt will be restructured, similar to way
+Mexico's debt was, minimizing losses to the creditor banks.

+<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>BankAmerica Corp is not under
+pressure to act quickly on its proposed equity offering and
+would do well to delay it because of the stock's recent poor
+performance, banking analysts said.
+    Some analysts said they have recommended BankAmerica delay
+its up to one-billion-dlr equity offering, which has yet to be
+approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
+    BankAmerica stock fell this week, along with other banking
+issues, on the news that Brazil has suspended interest payments
+on a large portion of its foreign debt.
+    The stock traded around 12, down 1/8, this afternoon,
+after falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news.
+    Banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of the
+First Interstate Bancorp &lt;I> takeover bid gone, BankAmerica is
+under no pressure to sell the securities into a market that
+will be nervous on bank stocks in the near term.
+    BankAmerica filed the offer on January 26. It was seen as
+one of the major factors leading the First Interstate
+withdrawing its takeover bid on February 9.
+    A BankAmerica spokesman said SEC approval is taking longer
+than expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated.
+    "The circumstances at the time will determine what we do,"
+said Arthur Miller, BankAmerica's Vice President for Financial
+Communications, when asked if BankAmerica would proceed with
+the offer immediately after it receives SEC approval.
+    "I'd put it off as long as they conceivably could," said
+Lawrence Cohn, analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
+Smith.
+    Cohn said the longer BankAmerica waits, the longer they
+have to show the market an improved financial outlook.
+    Although BankAmerica has yet to specify the types of
+equities it would offer, most analysts believed a convertible
+preferred stock would encompass at least part of it.
+    Such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean a
+lower conversion price and more dilution to BankAmerica stock
+holders, noted Daniel Williams, analyst with Sutro Group.
+    Several analysts said that while they believe the Brazilian
+debt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry
+through the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely to
+ease over the coming weeks.
+    Nevertheless, BankAmerica, which holds about 2.70 billion
+dlrs in Brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the
+interest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mln
+dlrs if Brazil pays no interest for a year, said Joseph
+Arsenio, analyst with Birr, Wilson and Co.
+    He noted, however, that any potential losses would not show
+up in the current quarter.
+    With other major banks standing to lose even more than
+BankAmerica if Brazil fails to service its debt, the analysts
+said they expect the debt will be restructured, similar to way
+Mexico's debt was, minimizing losses to the creditor banks.

+<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dean Foods Co expects earnings for the
+fourth quarter ending May 30 to exceed those of the same
+year-ago period, Chairman Kenneth Douglas told analysts.
+    In the fiscal 1986 fourth quarter the food processor
+reported earnings of 40 cts a share.
+    Douglas also said the year's sales should exceed 1.4
+billion dlrs, up from 1.27 billion dlrs the prior year.
+    He repeated an earlier projection that third-quarter
+earnings "will probably be off slightly" from last year's 40
+cts a share, falling in the range of 34 cts to 36 cts a share.
+    Douglas said it was too early to project whether the
+anticipated fourth quarter performance would be "enough for us
+to exceed the prior year's overall earnings" of 1.53 dlrs a
+share.
+    In 1988, Douglas said Dean should experience "a 20 pct
+improvement in our bottom line from effects of the tax reform
+act alone."
+    President Howard Dean said in fiscal 1988 the company will
+derive  benefits of various dairy and frozen vegetable
+acquisitions from Ryan Milk to the Larsen Co.
+    Dean also said the company will benefit from its
+acquisition in late December of Elgin Blenders Inc, West
+Chicago.
+    He said the company is a major shareholder of E.B.I. Foods
+Ltd, a United Kingdom blender, and has licensing arrangements
+in Australia, Canada, Brazil and Japan.
+    "It provides ann entry to McDonalds Corp &lt;MCD> we've been
+after for years," Douglas told analysts.

+<DATELINE>    LOUISVILLE, Ky., Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brown-Forman Inc said its board
+has approved a three-for-two stock split and a 35 pct increase
+in the company cash dividend.
+    The company cited its improved earnings outlook and

+    Brown-Forman said the split of its Class A and Class B
+common shares would be effective March 13.
+    The company said directors declared a quarterly cash
+dividend on each new share of both classes of 28 cts, payable
+April one to holders of record March 20. Prior to the split,
+the company had paid 31 cts quarterly.
+    Brown-Forman today reported a 37 pct increase in third 
+quarter profits to 21.6 mln dlrs, or 1.00 dlr a share, on a
+seven pct increase in sales to a record 337 mln dlrs.
+    Brown-Forman said nine month profits declined a bit to 66.0
+mln dlrs, or 3.07 dlrs a share, from 66.2 mln dlrs, or 3.08
+dlrs a share, a year earlier due to a second quarter charge of

+<TITLE>BANKERS REPORT BREAKTHROUGH ON VENEZUELAN DEBT</TITLE>
+<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Venezuela and its bank advisory
+committee have agreed in principle on revisions to the terms of
+a 21 billion dlr debt-rescheduling package signed last
+February, bankers said.
+    They declined to disclose details because two or three
+representatives on the panel have still to obtain the approval
+of their senior management for the new terms.
+    The committee was meeting in New York this afternoon and
+could put its final stamp of approval of the deal later today,
+the bankers said.
+    "A number of details have still to be finalized, but the
+broad details of the new amortization schedules and interest
+rates are in place," one senior banker said.
+    The interest rate on the rescheduling was originally set at
+1-1/8 pct over Eurodollar rates, but Venezuela requested easier
+terms because of a 40 pct drop in oil income last year.
+    It also asked for a reduction in the repayments it was due
+to make in 1987, 1988 and 1989 - after an earlier request that
+it make no amortizations at all in those years was rebuffed -
+and sought a commitment from the banks to finance new
+investment in Venezuela.
+    The breakthrough in the Venezuelan talks, which have been
+going on intermittently for several months, follows the
+announcement earlier today of a 10.6 billion dlr debt
+rescheduling pact between Chile and its bank advisory panel.
+    And last night Citibank said Mexico's financing package,
+including a 7.7 billion dlr loan, will be signed on March 20.
+    While the sudden progress is to some extent coincidental,
+bankers acknowledge a desire to chalk up some quick successes
+after the shock of Brazil's unilateral interest suspension last
+Friday. By striking swift deals, banks hope to reduce the
+incentive for other debtors to emulate Brazil.

+<TITLE>TOWER REPORT DIMINISHES REAGAN'S HOPES OF REBOUND</TITLE>
+<AUTHOR>    By Michael Gelb, Reuters</AUTHOR>
+<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Tower Commission report, which
+says President Reagan was ignorant about much of the Iran arms
+deal, just about ends his prospects of regaining political
+dominance in Washington, political analysts said.
+    "This is certification of incompetence," private political
+analyst Stephen Hess told Reuters in commenting on the Tower
+report made public today.
+    "It's as if he went before a professional licensing board
+and was denied credentials."
+    In one of the most direct criticisms, board chairman John
+Tower, a longtime Reagan supporter and former Republican
+senator from Texas, told a press conference, "The president
+clearly did not understand the nature of this operation."
+    The report, which lent credence to widespread opinion in
+Washington that Reagan is not in full command of the
+government, was particularly damaging because it was prepared
+by a board of the Republican president's own choosing.
+    The three-member panel made up of Tower, former National
+Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Secretary of State
+Edmund Muskie, does not carry the partisan taint of criticism
+from a Congress controlled by the Democratic party.
+    "We're falling by our own hand," said one Republican
+political strategist. "What can we say except 'we're sorry, we
+won't do it again'?"
+    The strategist, who works for one of his party's top 1988
+presidential contenders and asked not to be identified, said
+the report was like "an anvil falling on us."
+    Hess, with the Brookings Institution public policy study
+group, said the report is the final blow to Reagan's hopes of
+regaining the upper hand he once had in dealings with Congress,
+the press and the Washington bureaucracy.
+    The report may also undermine the standing of Defense
+Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Secretary of State George
+Shultz, who the report suggests were more interested in keeping
+their own skirts clean than supporting the president.
+    "They protected the record as to their own positions on this
+issue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect the
+president from the consequences," it said.
+    White House chief of staff Donald Regan and former Central
+Intelligence Agency Director William Casey also received strong
+criticism, but the blows were expected in their cases.
+    Regan, expected to resign or be fired shortly, was savaged
+for allegedly failing both to help Reagan conduct the Iran
+initiative and to avoid "chaos" in the disclosure process.
+    Casey, who underwent surgery for removal of a cancerous
+brain tumor in December, had already resigned for health
+reasons last month.
+    "This is a story about people who came up somewhat short of
+being heroes," Tower told reporters.
+    While Reagan retains considerable constitutional powers,
+including command of the armed forces and the right to veto
+legislation, analysts say it will be difficult for him to
+retake control of the country's policy agenda -- particularly
+with Congress controlled by the Democrats.
+    The crucial remaining question, they said, is whether the
+man in the street will forsake Reagan over the affair.
+    Although his job approval rating has fallen as much as
+twenty percentage points in some opinion polls since the arms
+deal with Iran became public last November, his personal
+popularity is still relatively high.
+    A Los Angeles Times poll released earlier this week showed
+that just 37 pct of those surveyed thought Reagan was in
+control of the government, but 55 pct still thought he was
+doing a good job as president.
+    American Enterprise Institute analyst William Schneider, a
+Democrat, says Reagan's loss of support among Washington power
+brokers could be offset by continued backing of the public.
+    "In the past, he has been able to go around the power elite
+by appealing directly to the public," Schneider said.
+    Reagan will again plead his case that way in a televised
+address next week.
+    But one top Republican strategist warned against expecting
+a dramatic turnaround.
+    "The White House has to avoid building expectations that
+cannot be met," said the strategist, who requested anonymity.
+"They have to recognize there is no quick fix."
+    Analysts also point out that Reagan's personal popularity
+has not always translated into public backing for his policies.
+    They note he was dramatically rebuffed in last November's
+elections when voters rejected his appeals and restored control
+of the Senate to the Democrats.

+<TITLE>SENATORS INTRODUCE EXPORT LICENSING REFORM BILL</TITLE>
+<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Cal.) and
+Daniel Evans (R-Wash.) said they introduced export licensing
+reform legislation that could save U.S. companies hundreds of
+thousands of dollars annually.
+    "Our emphasis is two-fold: Decontrol and de-license items
+where such actions will not endanger our national security, and
+eliminate the Department of Defense's de facto veto authority
+over the licensing process," Cranston said.
+    "Our reforms should reduce licensing requirements by 65  to
+70 pct," he told reporters. "I am convinced that a more
+rational...licensing process will boost exports."
+    U.S. export controls are intended to deny Eastern bloc
+countries access to technology that could further their
+military capabilities.
+    "By refocusing our control resources on higher levels of
+technology, technology that is truly critical, we will do a
+better job of preventing diversion of critical technology to
+our adversaries while promoting more exports," Cranston said.
+    "We cannot expect to continue to play a leading role in new
+technology development in the future if we unduly restrict the
+activities of U.S. firms in the world market-place," Evans told
+reporters.

+<TITLE>CHEMLAWN &lt;CHEM> RISES ON HOPES FOR HIGHER BIDS</TITLE>
+<AUTHOR>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</AUTHOR>
+<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>ChemLawn Corp &lt;CHEM> could attract a
+higher bid than the 27 dlrs per share offered by Waste
+Management Inc &lt;WNX>, Wall Street arbitrageurs said.
+    Shares of ChemLawn shot up 11-5/8 to 29-3/8 in
+over-the-counter- trading with 3.8 mln of the company's 10.1
+mln shares changing hands by late afternoon.
+    "This company could go for 10 times cash flow or 30 dlrs,
+maybe 32 dollars depending on whether there is a competing
+bidder," an arbitrageur said. Waste Management's tender offer,
+announced before the opening today, expires March 25.
+    "This is totally by surprise," said Debra Strohmaier, a
+ChemLawn spokeswoman. The company's board held a regularly
+scheduled meeting today and was discussing the Waste Management
+announcement. She said a statement was expected but it was not
+certain when it would be ready. 
+    She was unable to say if there had been any prior contact
+between Waste Management and ChemLawn officials.
+    "I think they will resist it," said Elliott Schlang,
+analyst at Prescott, Ball and Turben Inc. "Any company that
+doesn't like a surprise attack would."
+    Arbitrageurs pointed out it is difficult to resist tender
+offers for any and all shares for cash. Schlang said ChemLawn
+could try to find a white knight if does not want to be
+acquired by Waste Management.
+    Analyst Rosemarie Morbelli of Ingalls and Snyder said
+ServiceMaster Companies L.P. &lt;SVM> or Rollins Inc &lt;ROL> were
+examples of companies that could be interested.
+    ChemLawn, with about two mln customers, is the largest U.S.
+company involved in application of fertilizers, pesticides and
+herbicides on lawns. Waste Management is involved in removal of
+wastes.
+    Schlang said ChemLawn's customer base could be valuable to
+another company that wants to capitalize on a strong
+residential and commercial distribution system.
+    Both Schlang and Morbelli noted that high growth rates had
+catapulted ChemLawn's share price into the mid-30's in 1983 but
+the stock languished as the rate of growth slowed.

+<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb 26 - Brazil's "Cruzado" anti- </DATELINE><BODY>inflation
+plan, initially hailed at home and abroad as the saviour of the
+economy, is limping towards its first anniversary amid soaring
+prices, widespread shortages and a foreign payments crisis.
+    Announced last February 28 the plan froze prices, fixed the
+value of the new Cruzado currency and ended widespread
+indexation of the economy in a bid to halt the country's 250
+pct inflation rate.
+    But within a year the plan has all but collapsed.
+    "The situation now is worse than it was. Although there was
+inflation, at least the economy worked," a leading bank
+economist said.
+    The crumbling of the plan has been accompanied by a
+dramatic reversal in the foreign trade account. In 1984 and
+1985 Brazil's annual trade surpluses had been sufficient to
+cover the 12 billion dlrs needed to service its 109 billion dlr
+foreign debt.
+    For the first nine months of 1986 all seemed to be on
+target for a repeat, with monthly surpluses averaging one
+billion dlrs. But as exports were diverted and imports
+increased to avoid further domestic shortages the trade surplus
+plunged to 211 mln dlrs in October and since then has averaged
+under 150 mln.

+<TITLE>U.S. DATA POINT TO CAPITAL SPENDING SLOWDOWN</TITLE>
+<AUTHOR>    By Kathleen Hays, Reuters</AUTHOR>
+<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>A surprise 7.5 pct drop in U.S. January
+durable goods orders points to a slowdown in capital spending
+that could presage lackluster real growth in the U.S. economy
+in the first quarter of 1987, economists said.
+    With total orders, excluding the volatile defense sector,
+falling a record 9.9 pct, economists agreed that the report
+painted a bleak picture for the U.S. economy.
+    But they stressed that the 1987 tax reform laws may be a
+primary factor behind the drop in orders for business capital
+investment.
+    "It's a rather gloomy outlook for the economy, said David
+Wyss of Data Resources Inc. "I'm particularly impressed by the
+19.7 pct drop in non-defense capital goods orders because it
+may be a sign that businesses are reacting more adversely to
+tax reform than we thought."
+    The Commerce Department pointed out that a record 14.8 pct
+decline in new orders for machinery was led by declines in
+office and computing equipment orders.
+    Economists said the drop in computer orders may have been a
+response to the lengthening of depreciation schedules and the
+end of the investment tax credit under the new tax laws.
+    "It's more expensive to invest than it used to be, so
+people just aren't doing it as much," Wyss said.
+     Increases in durable goods orders at year's end reinforced
+the view that businesses anticipated the changing tax laws,
+economists said.
+    November durable goods orders rose 5.1 pct and December's
+increased 1.5 pct, revised upwards from a previously reported
+0.9 pct.
+    But most acknowledged that the huge January drop was caused
+by more than tax reform.
+    "The wash-out that took place in January was far greater
+than the actual gains that took place in November and
+December," said Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "The
+economy has a weakening bent to it early in the year."
+    "The report definitely points to very sluggish capital
+spending over the next couple of quarters," said Donald Maude
+of Midland Montagu Capital Markets Inc.
+    Maude pointed to a continuing decline in order backlogs as
+evidence that the outlook for new orders is not improving. In
+November, order backlogs rose 0.6 pct, but in December they
+fell 0.6 pct and in January 0.7 pct, he said.
+    "It suggests orders in the pipeline are depleting, which
+may quickly translate to a drop in production," Midland
+Montagu's Maude said.
+    Wyss cautioned that too much should not be made of
+January's report, given that other reports have reflected
+strength.
+    But he acknowledged that the decline occurred despite a 51
+pct rise in defense orders, compared with a 57.7 pct decline in
+December.
+    He also noted that there was a 6.9 pct drop in January
+shipments, compared with a 5.4 pct rise in December.
+    "Given these numbers, there's no reason for the Fed to
+tighten," Data Resources' Wyss said.
+    "But there's no reason to ease unless we see more numbers
+like this. The Fed will wait and see," he added.
+    Sullivan predicted the Fed will ease by Easter. "People
+aren't talking recession or Fed easing now, but the Fed will
+have to ease to ensure global growth."

+<TITLE>SENATORS INTRODUCE EXPORT LICENSING REFORM BILL</TITLE>
+<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Cal.) and
+Daniel Evans (R-Wash.) said they introduced export licensing
+reform legislation that could save U.S. companies hundreds of
+thousands of dollars annually.
+    "Our emphasis is two-fold: Decontrol and de-license items
+where such actions will not endanger our national security, and
+eliminate the Department of Defense's de facto veto authority
+over the licensing process," Cranston said.
+    "Our reforms should reduce licensing requirements by 65  to
+70 pct," he told reporters. "I am convinced that a more
+rational...licensing process will boost exports."
+    U.S. export controls are intended to deny Eastern bloc
+countries access to technology that could further their
+military capabilities.
+    "By refocusing our control resources on higher levels of
+technology, technology that is truly critical, we will do a
+better job of preventing diversion of critical technology to
+our adversaries while promoting more exports," Cranston said.
+    "We cannot expect to continue to play a leading role in new
+technology development in the future if we unduly restrict the
+activities of U.S. firms in the world market-place," Evans told
+reporters.

+<TITLE>BAHIA COCOA REVIEW</TITLE>
+<DATELINE>    SALVADOR, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Showers continued throughout the week in
+the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early
+January and improving prospects for the coming temporao,
+although normal humidity levels have not been restored,
+Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review.
+    The dry period means the temporao will be late this year.
+    Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags
+of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93
+mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems
+that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the
+arrivals figures.
+    Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how
+much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has
+practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates
+around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there
+are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers,
+middlemen, exporters and processors.
+    There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit
+for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in

+<TITLE>TALKING POINT/BANKAMERICA &lt;BAC> EQUITY OFFER</TITLE>
+<AUTHOR>    by Janie Gabbett, Reuters</AUTHOR>
+<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>BankAmerica Corp is not under
+pressure to act quickly on its proposed equity offering and
+would do well to delay it because of the stock's recent poor
+performance, banking analysts said.
+    Some analysts said they have recommended BankAmerica delay
+its up to one-billion-dlr equity offering, which has yet to be
+approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
+    BankAmerica stock fell this week, along with other banking
+issues, on the news that Brazil has suspended interest payments
+on a large portion of its foreign debt.
+    The stock traded around 12, down 1/8, this afternoon,
+after falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news.
+    Banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of the
+First Interstate Bancorp &lt;I> takeover bid gone, BankAmerica is
+under no pressure to sell the securities into a market that
+will be nervous on bank stocks in the near term.
+    BankAmerica filed the offer on January 26. It was seen as
+one of the major factors leading the First Interstate
+withdrawing its takeover bid on February 9.
+    A BankAmerica spokesman said SEC approval is taking longer
+than expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated.
+    "The circumstances at the time will determine what we do,"
+said Arthur Miller, BankAmerica's Vice President for Financial
+Communications, when asked if BankAmerica would proceed with
+the offer immediately after it receives SEC approval.
+    "I'd put it off as long as they conceivably could," said
+Lawrence Cohn, analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
+Smith.
+    Cohn said the longer BankAmerica waits, the longer they
+have to show the market an improved financial outlook.
+    Although BankAmerica has yet to specify the types of
+equities it would offer, most analysts believed a convertible
+preferred stock would encompass at least part of it.
+    Such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean a
+lower conversion price and more dilution to BankAmerica stock
+holders, noted Daniel Williams, analyst with Sutro Group.
+    Several analysts said that while they believe the Brazilian
+debt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry
+through the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely to
+ease over the coming weeks.
+    Nevertheless, BankAmerica, which holds about 2.70 billion
+dlrs in Brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the
+interest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mln
+dlrs if Brazil pays no interest for a year, said Joseph
+Arsenio, analyst with Birr, Wilson and Co.
+    He noted, however, that any potential losses would not show
+up in the current quarter.
+    With other major banks standing to lose even more than
+BankAmerica if Brazil fails to service its debt, the analysts
+said they expect the debt will be restructured, similar to way
+Mexico's debt was, minimizing losses to the creditor banks.

+<AUTHOR>    by Janie Gabbett, Reuters</AUTHOR>
+<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>BankAmerica Corp is not under
+pressure to act quickly on its proposed equity offering and
+would do well to delay it because of the stock's recent poor
+performance, banking analysts said.
+    Some analysts said they have recommended BankAmerica delay
+its up to one-billion-dlr equity offering, which has yet to be
+approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
+    BankAmerica stock fell this week, along with other banking
+issues, on the news that Brazil has suspended interest payments
+on a large portion of its foreign debt.
+    The stock traded around 12, down 1/8, this afternoon,
+after falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news.
+    Banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of the
+First Interstate Bancorp &lt;I> takeover bid gone, BankAmerica is
+under no pressure to sell the securities into a market that
+will be nervous on bank stocks in the near term.
+    BankAmerica filed the offer on January 26. It was seen as
+one of the major factors leading the First Interstate
+withdrawing its takeover bid on February 9.
+    A BankAmerica spokesman said SEC approval is taking longer
+than expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated.
+    "The circumstances at the time will determine what we do,"
+said Arthur Miller, BankAmerica's Vice President for Financial
+Communications, when asked if BankAmerica would proceed with
+the offer immediately after it receives SEC approval.
+    "I'd put it off as long as they conceivably could," said
+Lawrence Cohn, analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
+Smith.
+    Cohn said the longer BankAmerica waits, the longer they
+have to show the market an improved financial outlook.
+    Although BankAmerica has yet to specify the types of
+equities it would offer, most analysts believed a convertible
+preferred stock would encompass at least part of it.
+    Such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean a
+lower conversion price and more dilution to BankAmerica stock
+holders, noted Daniel Williams, analyst with Sutro Group.
+    Several analysts said that while they believe the Brazilian
+debt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry
+through the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely to
+ease over the coming weeks.
+    Nevertheless, BankAmerica, which holds about 2.70 billion
+dlrs in Brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the
+interest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mln
+dlrs if Brazil pays no interest for a year, said Joseph
+Arsenio, analyst with Birr, Wilson and Co.
+    He noted, however, that any potential losses would not show
+up in the current quarter.
+    With other major banks standing to lose even more than
+BankAmerica if Brazil fails to service its debt, the analysts
+said they expect the debt will be restructured, similar to way
+Mexico's debt was, minimizing losses to the creditor banks.

+<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dean Foods Co expects earnings for the
+fourth quarter ending May 30 to exceed those of the same
+year-ago period, Chairman Kenneth Douglas told analysts.
+    In the fiscal 1986 fourth quarter the food processor
+reported earnings of 40 cts a share.
+    Douglas also said the year's sales should exceed 1.4
+billion dlrs, up from 1.27 billion dlrs the prior year.
+    He repeated an earlier projection that third-quarter
+earnings "will probably be off slightly" from last year's 40
+cts a share, falling in the range of 34 cts to 36 cts a share.
+    Douglas said it was too early to project whether the
+anticipated fourth quarter performance would be "enough for us
+to exceed the prior year's overall earnings" of 1.53 dlrs a
+share.
+    In 1988, Douglas said Dean should experience "a 20 pct
+improvement in our bottom line from effects of the tax reform
+act alone."
+    President Howard Dean said in fiscal 1988 the company will
+derive  benefits of various dairy and frozen vegetable
+acquisitions from Ryan Milk to the Larsen Co.
+    Dean also said the company will benefit from its
+acquisition in late December of Elgin Blenders Inc, West
+Chicago.
+    He said the company is a major shareholder of E.B.I. Foods
+Ltd, a United Kingdom blender, and has licensing arrangements
+in Australia, Canada, Brazil and Japan.
+    "It provides ann entry to McDonalds Corp &lt;MCD> we've been
+after for years," Douglas told analysts.

+<DATELINE>    LOUISVILLE, Ky., Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brown-Forman Inc said its board
+has approved a three-for-two stock split and a 35 pct increase
+in the company cash dividend.
+    The company cited its improved earnings outlook and
+continued strong cash flow as reasons for raising the dividend.
+    Brown-Forman said the split of its Class A and Class B
+common shares would be effective March 13.
+    The company said directors declared a quarterly cash
+dividend on each new share of both classes of 28 cts, payable
+April one to holders of record March 20. Prior to the split,
+the company had paid 31 cts quarterly.
+    Brown-Forman today reported a 37 pct increase in third 
+quarter profits to 21.6 mln dlrs, or 1.00 dlr a share, on a
+seven pct increase in sales to a record 337 mln dlrs.
+    Brown-Forman said nine month profits declined a bit to 66.0
+mln dlrs, or 3.07 dlrs a share, from 66.2 mln dlrs, or 3.08
+dlrs a share, a year earlier due to a second quarter charge of
+37 cts a share for restructuring its beverage operations.
+    The company said lower corporate tax rates and the
+restructuring "are expected to substantially improve
+Brown-Forman's earnings and cash flow in fiscal 1988."

+<TITLE>BANKERS REPORT BREAKTHROUGH ON VENEZUELAN DEBT</TITLE>
+<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Venezuela and its bank advisory
+committee have agreed in principle on revisions to the terms of
+a 21 billion dlr debt-rescheduling package signed last
+February, bankers said.
+    They declined to disclose details because two or three
+representatives on the panel have still to obtain the approval
+of their senior management for the new terms.
+    The committee was meeting in New York this afternoon and
+could put its final stamp of approval of the deal later today,
+the bankers said.
+    "A number of details have still to be finalized, but the
+broad details of the new amortization schedules and interest
+rates are in place," one senior banker said.
+    The interest rate on the rescheduling was originally set at
+1-1/8 pct over Eurodollar rates, but Venezuela requested easier
+terms because of a 40 pct drop in oil income last year.
+    It also asked for a reduction in the repayments it was due
+to make in 1987, 1988 and 1989 - after an earlier request that
+it make no amortizations at all in those years was rebuffed -
+and sought a commitment from the banks to finance new
+investment in Venezuela.
+    The breakthrough in the Venezuelan talks, which have been
+going on intermittently for several months, follows the
+announcement earlier today of a 10.6 billion dlr debt
+rescheduling pact between Chile and its bank advisory panel.
+    And last night Citibank said Mexico's financing package,
+including a 7.7 billion dlr loan, will be signed on March 20.
+    While the sudden progress is to some extent coincidental,
+bankers acknowledge a desire to chalk up some quick successes
+after the shock of Brazil's unilateral interest suspension last
+Friday. By striking swift deals, banks hope to reduce the
+incentive for other debtors to emulate Brazil.

+<TITLE>TOWER REPORT DIMINISHES REAGAN'S HOPES OF REBOUND</TITLE>
+<AUTHOR>    By Michael Gelb, Reuters</AUTHOR>
+<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Tower Commission report, which
+says President Reagan was ignorant about much of the Iran arms
+deal, just about ends his prospects of regaining political
+dominance in Washington, political analysts said.
+    "This is certification of incompetence," private political
+analyst Stephen Hess told Reuters in commenting on the Tower
+report made public today.
+    "It's as if he went before a professional licensing board
+and was denied credentials."
+    In one of the most direct criticisms, board chairman John
+Tower, a longtime Reagan supporter and former Republican
+senator from Texas, told a press conference, "The president
+clearly did not understand the nature of this operation."
+    The report, which lent credence to widespread opinion in
+Washington that Reagan is not in full command of the
+government, was particularly damaging because it was prepared
+by a board of the Republican president's own choosing.
+    The three-member panel made up of Tower, former National
+Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Secretary of State
+Edmund Muskie, does not carry the partisan taint of criticism
+from a Congress controlled by the Democratic party.
+    "We're falling by our own hand," said one Republican
+political strategist. "What can we say except 'we're sorry, we
+won't do it again'?"
+    The strategist, who works for one of his party's top 1988
+presidential contenders and asked not to be identified, said
+the report was like "an anvil falling on us."
+    Hess, with the Brookings Institution public policy study
+group, said the report is the final blow to Reagan's hopes of
+regaining the upper hand he once had in dealings with Congress,
+the press and the Washington bureaucracy.
+    The report may also undermine the standing of Defense
+Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Secretary of State George
+Shultz, who the report suggests were more interested in keeping
+their own skirts clean than supporting the president.
+    "They protected the record as to their own positions on this
+issue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect the
+president from the consequences," it said.
+    White House chief of staff Donald Regan and former Central
+Intelligence Agency Director William Casey also received strong
+criticism, but the blows were expected in their cases.
+    Regan, expected to resign or be fired shortly, was savaged
+for allegedly failing both to help Reagan conduct the Iran
+initiative and to avoid "chaos" in the disclosure process.
+    Casey, who underwent surgery for removal of a cancerous
+brain tumor in December, had already resigned for health
+reasons last month.
+    "This is a story about people who came up somewhat short of
+being heroes," Tower told reporters.
+    While Reagan retains considerable constitutional powers,
+including command of the armed forces and the right to veto
+legislation, analysts say it will be difficult for him to
+retake control of the country's policy agenda -- particularly
+with Congress controlled by the Democrats.
+    The crucial remaining question, they said, is whether the
+man in the street will forsake Reagan over the affair.
+    Although his job approval rating has fallen as much as
+twenty percentage points in some opinion polls since the arms
+deal with Iran became public last November, his personal
+popularity is still relatively high.
+    A Los Angeles Times poll released earlier this week showed
+that just 37 pct of those surveyed thought Reagan was in
+control of the government, but 55 pct still thought he was
+doing a good job as president.
+    American Enterprise Institute analyst William Schneider, a
+Democrat, says Reagan's loss of support among Washington power
+brokers could be offset by continued backing of the public.
+    "In the past, he has been able to go around the power elite
+by appealing directly to the public," Schneider said.
+    Reagan will again plead his case that way in a televised
+address next week.
+    But one top Republican strategist warned against expecting
+a dramatic turnaround.
+    "The White House has to avoid building expectations that
+cannot be met," said the strategist, who requested anonymity.
+"They have to recognize there is no quick fix."
+    Analysts also point out that Reagan's personal popularity
+has not always translated into public backing for his policies.
+    They note he was dramatically rebuffed in last November's
+elections when voters rejected his appeals and restored control
+of the Senate to the Democrats.

+<TITLE>SENATORS INTRODUCE EXPORT LICENSING REFORM BILL</TITLE>
+<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Cal.) and
+Daniel Evans (R-Wash.) said they introduced export licensing
+reform legislation that could save U.S. companies hundreds of
+thousands of dollars annually.
+    "Our emphasis is two-fold: Decontrol and de-license items
+where such actions will not endanger our national security, and
+eliminate the Department of Defense's de facto veto authority
+over the licensing process," Cranston said.
+    "Our reforms should reduce licensing requirements by 65  to
+70 pct," he told reporters. "I am convinced that a more
+rational...licensing process will boost exports."
+    U.S. export controls are intended to deny Eastern bloc
+countries access to technology that could further their
+military capabilities.
+    "By refocusing our control resources on higher levels of
+technology, technology that is truly critical, we will do a
+better job of preventing diversion of critical technology to
+our adversaries while promoting more exports," Cranston said.
+    "We cannot expect to continue to play a leading role in new
+technology development in the future if we unduly restrict the
+activities of U.S. firms in the world market-place," Evans told
+reporters.

+<AUTHOR>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</AUTHOR>
+<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>ChemLawn Corp &lt;CHEM> could attract a
+higher bid than the 27 dlrs per share offered by Waste
+Management Inc &lt;WNX>, Wall Street arbitrageurs said.
+    Shares of ChemLawn shot up 11-5/8 to 29-3/8 in
+over-the-counter- trading with 3.8 mln of the company's 10.1
+mln shares changing hands by late afternoon.
+    "This company could go for 10 times cash flow or 30 dlrs,
+maybe 32 dollars depending on whether there is a competing
+bidder," an arbitrageur said. Waste Management's tender offer,
+announced before the opening today, expires March 25.
+    "This is totally by surprise," said Debra Strohmaier, a
+ChemLawn spokeswoman. The company's board held a regularly
+scheduled meeting today and was discussing the Waste Management
+announcement. She said a statement was expected but it was not
+certain when it would be ready. 
+    She was unable to say if there had been any prior contact
+between Waste Management and ChemLawn officials.
+    "I think they will resist it," said Elliott Schlang,
+analyst at Prescott, Ball and Turben Inc. "Any company that
+doesn't like a surprise attack would."
+    Arbitrageurs pointed out it is difficult to resist tender
+offers for any and all shares for cash. Schlang said ChemLawn
+could try to find a white knight if does not want to be
+acquired by Waste Management.
+    Analyst Rosemarie Morbelli of Ingalls and Snyder said
+ServiceMaster Companies L.P. &lt;SVM> or Rollins Inc &lt;ROL> were
+examples of companies that could be interested.
+    ChemLawn, with about two mln customers, is the largest U.S.
+company involved in application of fertilizers, pesticides and
+herbicides on lawns. Waste Management is involved in removal of
+wastes.
+    Schlang said ChemLawn's customer base could be valuable to
+another company that wants to capitalize on a strong
+residential and commercial distribution system.
+    Both Schlang and Morbelli noted that high growth rates had
+catapulted ChemLawn's share price into the mid-30's in 1983 but
+the stock languished as the rate of growth slowed.
+    Schlang said the company's profits are concentrated in the
+fourth quarter. In 1986 ChemLawn earned 1.19 dlrs per share for
+the full year, and 2.58 dlrs in the fourth quarter.
+    Morbelli noted ChemLawn competes with thousands of
+individual entrepreuers who offer lawn and garden care sevice.

+<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb 26 - Brazil's "Cruzado" anti- </DATELINE><BODY>inflation
+plan, initially hailed at home and abroad as the saviour of the
+economy, is limping towards its first anniversary amid soaring
+prices, widespread shortages and a foreign payments crisis.
+    Announced last February 28 the plan froze prices, fixed the
+value of the new Cruzado currency and ended widespread
+indexation of the economy in a bid to halt the country's 250
+pct inflation rate.
+    But within a year the plan has all but collapsed.
+    "The situation now is worse than it was. Although there was
+inflation, at least the economy worked," a leading bank
+economist said.
+    The crumbling of the plan has been accompanied by a
+dramatic reversal in the foreign trade account. In 1984 and
+1985 Brazil's annual trade surpluses had been sufficient to
+cover the 12 billion dlrs needed to service its 109 billion dlr
+foreign debt.
+    For the first nine months of 1986 all seemed to be on
+target for a repeat, with monthly surpluses averaging one
+billion dlrs. But as exports were diverted and imports
+increased to avoid further domestic shortages the trade surplus
+plunged to 211 mln dlrs in October and since then has averaged
+under 150 mln.

+<TITLE>U.S. DATA POINT TO CAPITAL SPENDING SLOWDOWN</TITLE>
+<AUTHOR>    By Kathleen Hays, Reuters</AUTHOR>
+<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>A surprise 7.5 pct drop in U.S. January
+durable goods orders points to a slowdown in capital spending
+that could presage lackluster real growth in the U.S. economy
+in the first quarter of 1987, economists said.
+    With total orders, excluding the volatile defense sector,
+falling a record 9.9 pct, economists agreed that the report
+painted a bleak picture for the U.S. economy.
+    But they stressed that the 1987 tax reform laws may be a
+primary factor behind the drop in orders for business capital
+investment.
+    "It's a rather gloomy outlook for the economy, said David
+Wyss of Data Resources Inc. "I'm particularly impressed by the
+19.7 pct drop in non-defense capital goods orders because it
+may be a sign that businesses are reacting more adversely to
+tax reform than we thought."
+    The Commerce Department pointed out that a record 14.8 pct
+decline in new orders for machinery was led by declines in
+office and computing equipment orders.
+    Economists said the drop in computer orders may have been a
+response to the lengthening of depreciation schedules and the
+end of the investment tax credit under the new tax laws.
+    "It's more expensive to invest than it used to be, so
+people just aren't doing it as much," Wyss said.
+     Increases in durable goods orders at year's end reinforced
+the view that businesses anticipated the changing tax laws,
+economists said.
+    November durable goods orders rose 5.1 pct and December's
+increased 1.5 pct, revised upwards from a previously reported
+0.9 pct.
+    But most acknowledged that the huge January drop was caused
+by more than tax reform.
+    "The wash-out that took place in January was far greater
+than the actual gains that took place in November and
+December," said Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "The
+economy has a weakening bent to it early in the year."
+    "The report definitely points to very sluggish capital
+spending over the next couple of quarters," said Donald Maude
+of Midland Montagu Capital Markets Inc.
+    Maude pointed to a continuing decline in order backlogs as
+evidence that the outlook for new orders is not improving. In
+November, order backlogs rose 0.6 pct, but in December they
+fell 0.6 pct and in January 0.7 pct, he said.
+    "It suggests orders in the pipeline are depleting, which
+may quickly translate to a drop in production," Midland
+Montagu's Maude said.
+    Wyss cautioned that too much should not be made of
+January's report, given that other reports have reflected
+strength.
+    But he acknowledged that the decline occurred despite a 51
+pct rise in defense orders, compared with a 57.7 pct decline in
+December.
+    He also noted that there was a 6.9 pct drop in January
+shipments, compared with a 5.4 pct rise in December.
+    "Given these numbers, there's no reason for the Fed to
+tighten," Data Resources' Wyss said.
+    "But there's no reason to ease unless we see more numbers
+like this. The Fed will wait and see," he added.
+    Sullivan predicted the Fed will ease by Easter. "People
+aren't talking recession or Fed easing now, but the Fed will
+have to ease to ensure global growth."

+<TITLE>SENATORS INTRODUCE EXPORT LICENSING REFORM BILL</TITLE>
+<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Cal.) and
+Daniel Evans (R-Wash.) said they introduced export licensing
+reform legislation that could save U.S. companies hundreds of
+thousands of dollars annually.
+    "Our emphasis is two-fold: Decontrol and de-license items
+where such actions will not endanger our national security, and
+eliminate the Department of Defense's de facto veto authority
+over the licensing process," Cranston said.
+    "Our reforms should reduce licensing requirements by 65  to
+70 pct," he told reporters. "I am convinced that a more
+rational...licensing process will boost exports."
+    U.S. export controls are intended to deny Eastern bloc
+countries access to technology that could further their
+military capabilities.
+    "By refocusing our control resources on higher levels of
+technology, technology that is truly critical, we will do a
+better job of preventing diversion of critical technology to
+our adversaries while promoting more exports," Cranston said.
+    "We cannot expect to continue to play a leading role in new
+technology development in the future if we unduly restrict the
+activities of U.S. firms in the world market-place," Evans told
+reporters.
