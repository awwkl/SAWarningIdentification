+Upgrading from Solr 3.1-dev
+----------------------
+
+* The Lucene index format has changed and as a result, once you upgrade, 
+  previous versions of Solr will no longer be able to read your indices.
+  In a master/slave configuration, all searchers/slaves should be upgraded
+  before the master.  If the master were to be updated first, the older
+  searchers would not be able to read the new index format.
+
+* Setting abortOnConfigurationError=false is no longer supported
+  (since it has never worked properly).  Solr will now warn you if
+  you attempt to set this configuration option at all. (see SOLR-1846)
+
+* The default logic for the 'mm' param of the 'dismax' QParser has
+  been changed.  If no 'mm' param is specified (either in the query,
+  or as a default in solrconfig.xml) then the effective value of the
+  'q.op' param (either in the query or as a default in solrconfig.xml
+  or from the 'defaultOperator' option in schema.xml) is used to
+  influence the behavior.  If q.op is effectively "AND" then mm=100%.
+  If q.op is effectively "OR" then mm=0%.  Users who wish to force the
+  legacy behavior should set a default value for the 'mm' param in
+  their solrconfig.xml file.
+
+Detailed Change List
+----------------------
+
+New Features
+----------------------
+  
+* SOLR-571: The autowarmCount for LRUCaches (LRUCache and FastLRUCache) now 
+  supports "percentages" which get evaluated  relative the current size of 
+  the cache when warming happens. 
+  (Tomas Fernandez Lobbe and hossman)
+  
+* SOLR-1915: DebugComponent now supports using a NamedList to model
+  Explanation objects in it's responses instead of
+  Explanation.toString  (hossman) 
+
+* SOLR-1932: New relevancy function queries: termfreq, tf, docfreq, idf
+  norm, maxdoc, numdocs. (yonik)
+
+* SOLR-1682: (SOLR-236, SOLR-237, SOLR-1773, SOLR-1311) Search grouping / Field collapsing.
+  (Martijn van Groningen, Emmanuel Keller, Shalin Shekhar Mangar,
+   Koji Sekiguchi, Ivï¿? de Prado, Ryan McKinley, Marc Sturlese, Peter Karich,
+   Bojan Smid, Charles Hornberger, Dieter Grad, Dmitry Lihachev, Doug Steigerwald,
+   Karsten Sperling, Michael Gundlach, Oleg Gnatovskiy, Thomas Traeger,
+   Harish Agarwal, yonik)
+
+* SOLR-1665: Add debug component options for timings, results and query info only (gsingers, hossman, yonik)
+
+* SOLR-2113: Add TermQParserPlugin, registered as "term".  This is useful
+  when generating filter queries from terms returned from field faceting or
+  the terms component. Example: fq={!term f=weight}1.5   (hossman, yonik) 
+
+* SOLR-2001: The query component will substitute an empty query that matches
+  no documents if the query parser returns null.  This also prevents an
+  exception from being thrown by the default parser if "q" is missing. (yonik)
+
+* SOLR-2112: Solrj API now supports streaming results. (ryan)
+
+* SOLR-792: Adding PivotFacetComponent for Hierarchical faceting
+  (erik, Jeremy Hinegardner, Thibaut Lassalle, ryan)
+
+* LUCENE-2507: Added DirectSolrSpellChecker, which uses Lucene's DirectSpellChecker
+  to retrieve correction candidates directly from the term dictionary using
+  levenshtein automata.  (rmuir)
+   
+* SOLR-1873: SolrCloud - added shared/central config and core/shard managment via zookeeper,
+  built-in load balancing, and infrastructure for future SolrCloud work. 
+  (yonik, Mark Miller)
+
+* SOLR-1729: Evaluation of NOW for date math is done only once per request for
+  consistency, and is also propagated to shards in distributed search.
+  Adding a parameter NOW=<time_in_ms> to the request will override the
+  current time.  (Peter Sturge, yonik)
+
+Optimizations
+----------------------
+
+* SOLR-1875: Per-segment field faceting for single valued string fields.
+  Enable with facet.method=fcs, control the number of threads used with
+  the "threads" local param on the facet.field param.  This algorithm will
+  only be faster in the presence of rapid index changes.  (yonik)
+
+* SOLR-1904: When facet.enum.cache.minDf > 0 and the base doc set is a
+  SortedIntSet, convert to HashDocSet for better performance. (yonik)
+
+* SOLR-1843: A new "rootName" attribute is now available when
+  configuring <jmx/> in solrconfig.xml.  If this attribute is set,
+  Solr will use it as the root name for all MBeans Solr exposes via
+  JMX.  The default root name is "solr" followed by the core name.
+  (Constantijn Visinescu, hossman)
+
+* SOLR-2092: Speed up single-valued and multi-valued "fc" faceting. Typical
+  improvement is 5%, but can be much greater (up to 10x faster) when facet.offset
+  is very large (deep paging). (yonik)
+
+Bug Fixes
+----------------------
+
+* SOLR-1908: Fixed SignatureUpdateProcessor to fail to initialize on
+  invalid config.  Specificly: a signatureField that does not exist,
+  or overwriteDupes=true with a signatureField that is not indexed.
+  (hossman)
+
+* SOLR-1824: IndexSchema will now fail to initialize if there is a
+  problem initializing one of the fields or field types. (hossman)
+
+* SOLR-1928: TermsComponent didn't correctly break ties for non-text
+  fields sorted by count. (yonik)
+
+* SOLR-2107: MoreLikeThisHandler doesn't work with alternate qparsers. (yonik)
+
+* SOLR-2108: Fixed false positives when using wildcard queries on fields with reversed
+  wildcard support. For example, a query of *zemog* would match documents that contain
+  'gomez'.  (Landon Kuhn via Robert Muir)
+
+* SOLR-1962: SolrCore#initIndex should not use a mix of indexPath and newIndexPath (Mark Miller)
+
+* SOLR-2275: fix DisMax 'mm' parsing to be tolerant of whitespace
+  (Erick Erickson via hossman)
+
+Other Changes
+----------------------
+
+* SOLR-1846: Eliminate support for the abortOnConfigurationError
+  option.  It has never worked very well, and in recent versions of
+  Solr hasn't worked at all.  (hossman)
+
+* SOLR-1889: The default logic for the 'mm' param of DismaxQParser and
+  ExtendedDismaxQParser has been changed to be determined based on the
+  effective value of the 'q.op' param (hossman)
+
+* SOLR-1946: Misc improvements to the SystemInfoHandler: /admin/system
+  (hossman)
+
+* SOLR-2289: Tweak spatial coords for example docs so they are a bit
+  more spread out (Erick Erickson via hossman)
+
+* SOLR-2288: Small tweaks to eliminate compiler warnings.  primarily
+  using Generics where applicable in method/object declatations, and
+  adding @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") when appropriate (hossman)
+
+Documentation
