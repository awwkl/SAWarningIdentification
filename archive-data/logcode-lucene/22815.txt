 Format is Optional. -1 indicates DGaps. Non-negative value indicates Bits, and that Format is
 excluded.
+
 ByteCount indicates the number of bytes in Bits. It is typically (SegSize/8)+1.
+
 BitCount indicates the number of bits that are currently set in Bits.
+
 Bits contains one bit for each document indexed. When the bit corresponding to a document
 number is set, that document is marked as deleted. Bit ordering is from least to most
 significant. Thus, if Bits contains two bytes, 0x00 and 0x02, then document 9 is marked as
 deleted.

 DGaps represents sparse bit-vectors more efficiently than Bits. It is made of DGaps on
 indexes of nonzero bytes in Bits, and the nonzero bytes themselves. The number of nonzero
