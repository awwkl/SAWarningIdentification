+BitCount indicates the number of bits that are currently set in Bits.
 Bits contains one bit for each document indexed. When the bit corresponding to a document
 number is set, that document is marked as deleted. Bit ordering is from least to most
 significant. Thus, if Bits contains two bytes, 0x00 and 0x02, then document 9 is marked as
 deleted.

 DGaps represents sparse bit-vectors more efficiently than Bits. It is made of DGaps on
 indexes of nonzero bytes in Bits, and the nonzero bytes themselves. The number of nonzero
 bytes in Bits (NonzeroBytesCount) is not stored.
