-This is the README file for webcrawler-LARM contribution to Lucene Sandbox.
+See information on the website on 
+http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/lucene-sandbox/larm/overview.html
 
-This contribution requires:
-
-a) HTTPClient.jar (not Jakarta's, but this one:
-    http://www.innovation.ch/java/HTTPClient/
-b) Jakarta ORO package for regular expressions
-
-Put the .jars into the lib directory. 
-
-Some of the HTTPClient source files will be replaced during the build, so they 
-will be needed during the build. Sorry, I remember I couldn't do that with
-inheritance.
-
-- This contribution also uses portions of the HeX HTML parser, which is
-included.
-
-OG>  I am not sure if Clemens' modified this parser in any way.  If not,
-OG>  maybe we don't have to include it and can instead just add it to the
-OG>  list of required packages.
-
-The parser was put upside down. Although it apparently still needs some 
-of the original interfaces, most of them can probably be removed. I will check
-that out.
-
-OG>  This code requires(?) JDK 1.4, as it uses assert keyword.
-
-No. It still contains a method called assert() for testing. I will probably 
-rename this sometime (e.g. when changing the tests to JUnit).
