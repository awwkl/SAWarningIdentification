+
 Format is Optional. -1 indicates DGaps. Non-negative value indicates Bits, and that Format is
 excluded.
+
 ByteCount indicates the number of bytes in Bits. It is typically (SegSize/8)+1.
+
 BitCount indicates the number of bits that are currently set in Bits.
+
 Bits contains one bit for each document indexed. When the bit corresponding to a document
 number is set, that document is marked as deleted. Bit ordering is from least to most
 significant. Thus, if Bits contains two bytes, 0x00 and 0x02, then document 9 is marked as
 deleted.
+
 DGaps represents sparse bit-vectors more efficiently than Bits. It is made of DGaps on
 indexes of nonzero bytes in Bits, and the nonzero bytes themselves. The number of nonzero
 bytes in Bits (NonzeroBytesCount) is not stored.
+
 For example, if there are 8000 bits and only bits 10,12,32 are set, DGaps would be used:
+
 (VInt) 1 , (byte) 20 , (VInt) 3 , (Byte) 1

 There are a few places where these file formats limit the maximum number of terms and
 documents to a 32-bit quantity, or to approximately 4 billion. This is not today a problem,
 but, in the long term, probably will be. These should therefore be replaced with either UInt64
-values, or better yet, with VInt values which have no limit.
