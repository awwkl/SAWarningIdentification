 Apache Solr is a search server based on the Apache Lucene search

+Apache Solr is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
+Foundation (ASF), sponsored by Apache Lucene. Incubation is required of all
+newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the
+infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in
+a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status
+is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code,
+it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
 
 For a complete description of the Solr project, team composition, source
 code repositories, and other details, please see the Solr incubation web site at
