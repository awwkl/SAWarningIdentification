     Mixed flex/pre-flex indexes are perfectly fine -- the two
     emulation layers (flex API on pre-flex index, and pre-flex API on
     flex index) will remap the access as required.  So on upgrading to
-    3.1 you can start indexing new documents into an existing index.
+    4.0 you can start indexing new documents into an existing index.
     To get optimal performance, use oal.index.IndexUpgrader
     to upgrade your indexes to latest file format (LUCENE-3082).
