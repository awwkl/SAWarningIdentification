+<title>Jakarta Lucene - Getting Started Guide</title>
+</properties>
+<body>
+
+<section name="About this Document">
+<p>
+This document is intended as a "getting started" guide.  It has three basic 
+audiences: novices looking to install Jakarta Lucene on their application or 
+web server, developers looking to modify or base the applications they develop
+on Lucene, and developers looking to become involved in and contribute to the
+development of Lucene.  This document is written in tutorial and walkthrough 
+format.  It intends to help you in "getting started", but does not go into great
+depth into some of the conceptual or inner details of Jakarta Lucene.
+</p>
+</section>
+
+<section name="Format of this Guide">
+<p>
+Each section listed below builds on one another.  That being said more advanced users may
+wish to skip sections.  
+</p>
+</section>
+
+<section name="The Simple Demo">
+<p>
+In <a href="demo.html">this</a> section we walk through the basic Lucene demo and executing it.  
+This section is intended for anyone who wants a basic background on using the provided Lucene demos.
+</p>
+</section>
+
+<section name="Simple Demo Source Walkthrough">
+<p>
+In <a href="demo2.html">this</a> section we walk through the sources and implementation
+for the basic Lucene demo.  This section is intended for developers.  
+</p>
+</section>
+
+<section name="Template Web Application">
+<p>
+In <a href="demo3.html">this</a> section we walk through installing 
+and configuring the template web application.  While this walkthough assumes 
+Tomcat 4.0.x as your container of choice, there is no reason you can't (provided you have
+the requisite knowledge) adapt the instructions to your container.  This section is intended
+for those responsible for the development or deployment of Lucene-based web applications.
+</p>
+</section>
+
+<section name="Template Web Application sources">
+<p>
+In <a href="demo4.html">this</a> section we walk through the sources used to construct the 
+template web application.  Please note the template application is designed to highlight 
+features of Lucene and is <b>not</b> an example of best practices.  (One would hopefully 
+use MVC architecture such as provided by Jakarta Struts and taglibs, or better yet XML 
+with stylesheets, but showing you how to do that would be WAY beyond the scope of this 
+demonstration.  Additionally once could cache results, and perform other performance 
+optimizations, but those are beyond the scope of this demo).
+</p>
+<p>  
+This section is intended for developers and those wishing to customize the template web 
+application to their needs.  The sections useful to developers only are clearly delineated.
