     java.util.BitSet. This allows using more efficient data structures
     for Filters and makes them more flexible. This deprecates
     Filter.bits(), so all filters that implement this outside
     the Lucene code base will need to be adapted. See also the javadocs
     of the Filter class. (Paul Elschot, Michael Busch)

     IndexWriter.commit().  (Mike McCandless)

     consult the MergePolicy to find merges necessary to merge away all
     deletes from the index.  This should be a somewhat lower cost
