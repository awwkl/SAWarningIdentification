 Changes in backwards compatibility policy
 
+   
+ * LUCENE-2323: Moved contrib/wikipedia functionality into contrib/analyzers.
+   Additionally the package was changed from org.apache.lucene.wikipedia.analysis
+   to org.apache.lucene.analysis.wikipedia.  (Robert Muir)
+
+ * LUCENE-2413: Consolidated all analyzers into contrib/analyzers. 
+   - contrib/analyzers/smartcn now depends on contrib/analyzers/common
+   - The "AnalyzerUtil" in wordnet was removed. 
+   ... (in progress)
+
+Bug fixes
+
+ * LUCENE-2404: Fix bugs with position increment and empty tokens in ThaiWordFilter.
+   For matchVersion >= 3.1 the filter also no longer lowercases. ThaiAnalyzer
+
+API Changes
+
+ * LUCENE-2413: Deprecated PatternAnalyzer in contrib/analyzers, in favor of the 
+   pattern package (CharFilter, Tokenizer, TokenFilter).  (Robert Muir)
+   
+New features
+
+ * LUCENE-2399: Add ICUNormalizer2Filter, which normalizes tokens with ICU's
+   Normalizer2. This allows for efficient combinations of normalization and custom 
+   mappings in addition to standard normalization, and normalization combined
+   with unicode case folding.  (Robert Muir)
+
+ * LUCENE-1343: Add ICUFoldingFilter, a replacement for ASCIIFoldingFilter that
+   does a more thorough job of normalizing unicode text for search.
+   (Robert Haschart, Robert Muir)
+
+ * LUCENE-2409: Add ICUTransformFilter, which transforms text in a context
+   sensitive way, either from ICU built-in rules (such as Traditional-Simplified),
+   or from rules you write yourself.  (Robert Muir)
+
+ * LUCENE-2298: Add analyzers/stempel, an algorithmic stemmer with support for
+   the Polish language.  (Andrzej Bialecki via Robert Muir)
+
+ * LUCENE-2414: Add ICUTokenizer, a tailorable tokenizer that implements Unicode
+   Text Segmentation. This tokenizer is useful for documents or collections with
+   multiple languages.  The default configuration includes special support for
+   Thai, Lao, Myanmar, and Khmer.  (Robert Muir, Uwe Schindler)
+
+ * LUCENE-2413: Consolidated Solr analysis components into contrib/analyzers. 
+   New features from Solr now available to Lucene users include:
+   - o.a.l.analysis.commongrams: Constructs n-grams for frequently occurring terms
+     and phrases. 
+   - o.a.l.analysis.charfilter.HTMLStripCharFilter: CharFilter that strips HTML 
+     constructs.
+   - o.a.l.analysis.miscellaneous.WordDelimiterFilter: TokenFilter that splits words 
+     into subwords and performs optional transformations on subword groups.
+   - o.a.l.analysis.miscellaneous.RemoveDuplicatesTokenFilter: TokenFilter which 
+     filters out Tokens at the same position and Term text as the previous token.
+   - o.a.l.analysis.pattern: Package for pattern-based analysis, containing a 
+     CharFilter, Tokenizer, and Tokenfilter for transforming text with regexes.

  * LUCENE-2100: All Analyzers in Lucene-contrib have been marked as final.
    Analyzers should be only act as a composition of TokenStreams, users should
    compose their own analyzers instead of subclassing existing ones.
