 Optimizations
 
+ * LUCENE-1965, LUCENE-1962: Arabic-, Persian- and SmartChineseAnalyzer
+   loads default stopwords only once if accessed for the first time.
+   Previous versions where loading the stopword files each time a new
+   instance was created. This might improve performance for applications
+   creating lots of instances of these Analyzers. (Simon Willnauer)
