+The tools, documentation, etc. in this directory are intended to be helpful to developers of Lucene and Solr.  They are not necessarily maintained in the same way that the core code is maintained and so your mileage may vary as to the usefulness of the tools.
+
+Description of directories:
+./size-estimator-lucene-solr -- Spreadsheet for estimating memory and disk usage in Lucene/Solr
+./eclipse -- Used to generate project descriptors for the Eclipse IDE.
+./idea -- Similar to Eclipse, but for IntelliJ's IDEA IDE.
+./maven -- Mavenizes the Lucene/Solr packages
+./scripts -- Odds and ends for building releases, etc.
