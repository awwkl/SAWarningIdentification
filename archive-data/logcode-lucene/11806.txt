+Bug Fixes
+
+* LUCENE-3969: Throw IAE on bad arguments that could cause confusing 
+  errors in KeywordTokenizer. 
+  (Uwe Schindler, Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)
+
+* LUCENE-3971: MappingCharFilter could return invalid final token position.
+  (Dawid Weiss, Robert Muir)
+
+* LUCENE-4023: DisjunctionMaxScorer now implements visitSubScorers().
+  (Uwe Schindler)
+
+* LUCENE-2566: + - operators allow any amount of whitespace (yonik, janhoy)
+
+* LUCENE-3590: Fix AIOOBE in BytesRef/CharsRef copyBytes/copyChars when 
+  offset is nonzero, fix off-by-one in CharsRef.subSequence, and fix
+  CharsRef's CharSequence methods to throw exceptions in boundary cases
+  to properly meet the specification.  (Robert Muir)
+
+* LUCENE-4222: TieredMergePolicy.getFloorSegmentMB was returning the
+  size in bytes not MB (Chris Fuller via Mike McCandless)
+
+API Changes
+
+* LUCENE-4023: Changed the visibility of Scorer#visitSubScorers() to
+  public, otherwise it's impossible to implement Scorers outside
+  the Lucene package.  (Uwe Schindler)
+
+Optimizations
+
+* LUCENE-4163: Improve concurrency of MMapIndexInput.clone() by using
+  the new WeakIdentityMap on top of a ConcurrentHashMap to manage
+  the cloned instances. WeakIdentityMap was extended to support
+  iterating over its keys.  (Uwe Schindler)
+
+Tests
+
+* LUCENE-3873: add MockGraphTokenFilter, testing analyzers with
+  random graph tokens.  (Mike McCandless)
+
+* LUCENE-3968: factor out LookaheadTokenFilter from
