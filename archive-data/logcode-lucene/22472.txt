-                    <br>
-                    Lucene is a high performance, scalable, cross-platform search engine that contains many advanced
-                    features that often go untapped by the majority of users. In this session, designed for those
-                    familiar with Lucene, we will examine some of Lucene's more advanced topics and their application,
-                    including:
-                </p>
-<ol>
-                    
-<li>Term Vectors: Manual and Pseudo relevance feedback; Advanced document collection analysis for
-                        domain specialization</li>
-                    
-<li>Span Queries: Better phrase matching; Candidate Identification for Question Answering</li>
-                    
-<li>Tying it all Together: Building a search framework for experimentation and rapid deployment</li>

-                        Sublanguage specialization for commercial trouble ticket analysis; Passage retrieval and

-                    </li>
-                
-</ol>
-<p>Topics 1 through 3 will provide technical details on implementing the advanced Lucene features, while
-                    the fourth topic will provide a broader context for understanding when and where to use these
-                    features.

-                <p>This is mostly a bugfix release from release 1.9.1.
-                    Note however that deprecated 1.x features have now
-                    been removed. Any code that compiles against Lucene
-                    1.9.1 without deprecation warnings should work without
-                    further changes with any 2.x release. For more
-                    information about this release, please read

-                <p>This release has many improvements since release
-                    1.4.3, including new features, performance
-                    improvements, bug fixes, etc. See

-
-                <p>1.9 will be the last 1.x release. It is both
-                    back-compatible with 1.4.3 and forward-compatible with
-                    the upcoming 2.0 release. Many methods and classes in
-                    1.4.3 have been deprecated in 1.9 and will be removed
-                    in 2.0. Applications must compile against 1.9 without
-                    deprecation warnings before they are compatible with
-                    2.0.</p>

-                    Abstract:
-                    <br/>
-                    Lucene is a high performance, scalable, cross-platform search engine that contains many advanced
-                    features that often go untapped by the majority of users. In this session, designed for those
-                    familiar with Lucene, we will examine some of Lucene's more advanced topics and their application,
-                    including:
-                </p>
-                <ol>
-                    <li>Term Vectors: Manual and Pseudo relevance feedback; Advanced document collection analysis for
-                        domain specialization</li>
-                    <li>Span Queries: Better phrase matching; Candidate Identification for Question Answering</li>
-                    <li>Tying it all Together: Building a search framework for experimentation and rapid deployment</li>
-                    <li>Case Studies from
-                        <a href="http://www.cnlp.org">CNLP</a>
-                        : Crosslingual/multilingual retrieval in Arabic, English and Dutch;
-                        Sublanguage specialization for commercial trouble ticket analysis; Passage retrieval and
-                        analysis for Question Answering application
-                    </li>
-                </ol>
-                <p>Topics 1 through 3 will provide technical details on implementing the advanced Lucene features, while
-                    the fourth topic will provide a broader context for understanding when and where to use these
-                    features.

-                <p>Lucene has migrated from Apache's Jakarta project to the top-level. Along with this migration,
-                    the source code repository has been converted to Subversion. The migration is in progress with
-                    some loose ends. Please stay tuned!
