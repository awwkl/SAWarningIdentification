+Below is the license for JavaCC that you must agree to when you install
+JavaCC.
+
+We are not distributing JavaCC with the binary distribution of Lucene,
+therefore, we feel that we do not need a separate license with MetaMata.
+We only have a copy of the JavaCC.zip file (which contains the JavaCC
+related .class files) in CVS.
+
+Our goal is not to violate this license and do harm in any way. If you
+find that we are in violation of the license, please let us know and
+tell us the steps to correct our misuse.
+
+Thanks!
+
+The Lucene Team
