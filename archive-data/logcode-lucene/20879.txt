  7. LUCENE-1461: Added FieldCacheRangeFilter, a RangeFilter for
     single-term fields that uses FieldCache to compute the filter.  If
-    your field has a single term per document, and you need to create
-    many RangeFilters with varying lower/upper bounds, then this is
-    likely a much faster way to create the filters than RangeFilter.
-    However, it comes at the expense of added RAM consumption and
-    slower first-time usage due to populating the FieldCache.  (Tim
-    Sturge via Mike McCandless)
