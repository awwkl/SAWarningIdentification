- * LUCENE-2413: Moved the demo out of lucene core and into contrib/demo.
-   (Robert Muir)
-
  * LUCENE-2845: Moved contrib/benchmark to modules.
 
 New Features
 
-  * LUCENE-2604: Added RegexpQuery support to contrib/queryparser.
-    (Simon Willnauer, Robert Muir)
-
-  * LUCENE-2500: Added DirectIOLinuxDirectory, a Linux-specific
-    Directory impl that uses the O_DIRECT flag to bypass the buffer
-    cache.  This is useful to prevent segment merging from evicting
-    pages from the buffer cache, since fadvise/madvise do not seem.

-  * LUCENE-2373: Added a Codec implementation that works with append-only
-    filesystems (such as e.g. Hadoop DFS). SegmentInfos writing/reading
-    code is refactored to support append-only FS, and to allow for future
-    customization of per-segment information. (Andrzej Bialecki)

-    that doesn't synchronize on the file handle. This can be useful to

 Bug fixes
 
+ * LUCENE-2855: contrib queryparser was using CharSequence as key in some internal
