 * ZooKeeper is upgraded from 3.4.5 to 3.4.6.
 
+* <fields> and <types> tags have been deprecated. There is no longer any reason to
+  keep them in the schema file, they may be safely removed. This allows intermixing of
+  <fieldType>, <field> and <copyField> definitions if desired. Currently, these tags
+  are supported so either style may be implemented. TBD is whether they'll be
