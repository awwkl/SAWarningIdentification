 * SOLR-2949: QueryElevationComponent is now supported with distributed search.

+* SOLR-3221: Added the ability to directly configure aspects of the concurrency

+ grained controlled and can be tuned by end users to target their own specific
+ requirements. This builds on the work of the HttpCommComponent and uses the same configuration
