  * LUCENE-3697: SimpleBoundaryScanner does not work well when highlighting
    at the beginning of the text. (Shay Banon via Koji Sekiguchi)
 
+ * LUCENE-3703: Calling DirectoryTaxonomyReader.refresh() could mess up
+   reference counting (e.g. if application called incRef/decRef). Also,
+   getRefCount() no longer checks if the taxonomy reader is already closed.

  * LUCENE-3719: FVH: slow performance on very large queries.
    (Igor Motov via Koji Sekiguchi)

  * LUCENE-3765: As of Version.LUCENE_36, DutchAnalyzer's two ctors
    that take stopwords and stem exclusion tables also initialize
    the default stem overrides (e.g. kind/kinder, fiets).  (Robert Muir)
