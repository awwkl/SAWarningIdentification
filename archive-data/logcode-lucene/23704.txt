-   * running out of memory.<p/>
-   * Note that this effectively truncates large documents, excluding from the
-   * index terms that occur further in the document.  If you know your source
-   * documents are large, be sure to set this value high enough to accomodate
-   * the expected size.  If you set it to Integer.MAX_VALUE, then the only limit
-   * is your memory, but you should anticipate an OutOfMemoryError.<p/>
-   * By default, no more than 10,000 terms will be indexed for a field.

+   * Since Documents are merged in a {@link org.apache.lucene.store.RAMDirectory},
+   * large value gives faster indexing.  At the same time, mergeFactor limits
