 /** Implements the wildcard search query. Supported wildcards are <code>*</code>, which
  * matches any character sequence (including the empty one), and <code>?</code>,
  * which matches any single character. Note this query can be slow, as it
- * needs to iterate over all terms. In order to prevent extremely slow WildcardQueries,
- * a Wildcard term must not start with one of the wildcards <code>*</code> or
+ * needs to iterate over many terms. In order to prevent extremely slow WildcardQueries,
+ * a Wildcard term should not start with one of the wildcards <code>*</code> or
  * <code>?</code>.
