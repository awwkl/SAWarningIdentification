 Upgrading from Solr 1.3
 -----------------------
 
+New users of Solr 1.4 will have omitTf enabled for non-text indexed fields by
+default, which avoids indexing term frequency, positions, and payloads, making
+the index smaller and faster.  If you are upgrading from an earlier Solr
+release and want to enable omitTf by default, change the schema version from
+1.1 to 1.2 in schema.xml.  Remove any existing index and restart Solr to ensure that omitTf completely takes affect.
