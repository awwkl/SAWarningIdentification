 ========================= Solr Change Log ==============================
 $Id$
 
+Apache Solr is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
+Foundation (ASF), sponsored by Apache Lucene. Incubation is required of all
+newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the
+infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in
+a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status
+is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code,
+it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
+
+
 New Features
  1. added support for setting Lucene's positionIncrementGap
  2. Admin: new statistics for SolrIndexSearcher
