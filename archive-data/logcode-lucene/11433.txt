+
+      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
+      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
+      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
+      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

+      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
+      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
+      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
+
+   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

+      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
+      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
+      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+      as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+      meet the following conditions:

+      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+          the Derivative Works; and
+
+      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+          as modifying the License.
+
+      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+      the conditions stated in this License.
+
+   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
+

+     combination of the Original Code and Modifications, in each case
+     including portions thereof.

+     Code.
+
+     1.6. "Initial Developer" means the individual or entity identified
+     as the Initial Developer in the Source Code notice required by Exhibit
+     A.

+     substance or structure of either the Original Code or any previous
+     Modifications. When Covered Code is released as a series of files, a

+     The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
+     non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
+     claims:
+          (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
+          trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,
+          modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original
+          Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or
+          as part of a Larger Work; and
+
+          (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or
+          selling of Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice,
+          sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the
+          Original Code (or portions thereof).
+
+          (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are
+          effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes
+          Original Code under the terms of this License.
+
+          (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
+          granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2)
+          separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused
+          by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the
+          combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.
+
+     2.2. Contributor Grant.
+     Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor
+     hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license
+
+          (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
+          trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,
+          display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications
+          created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an
+          unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code
+          and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
+
+          (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or
+          selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone
+          and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions
+          of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have
+          made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that
+          Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of
+          Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor
+          Version (or portions of such combination).
+
+          (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are
+          effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of
+          the Covered Code.
+
+          (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
+          granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the
+          Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version;
+          3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of
+          Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made
+          by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the
+          Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
+          infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
+          that Contributor.
+
+3. Distribution Obligations.
+
+     3.1. Application of License.
+     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
+     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
+     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
+     distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
+     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
+     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
+     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
+     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
+     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
+     an additional document offering the additional rights described in
+     Section 3.5.
+
+     3.2. Availability of Source Code.
+     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
+     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
+     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
+     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
+     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
+     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
+     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
+     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
+     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
+     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
+     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
+
+     3.3. Description of Modifications.
+     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
+     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
+     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
+     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
+     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
+     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
+     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
+     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
+
+     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
+          (a) Third Party Claims.
+          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
+          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
+          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
+          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
+          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
+          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
+          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
+          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
+          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
+          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
+          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
+          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
+          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
+
+          (b) Contributor APIs.
+          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
+          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
+          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
+          also include this information in the LEGAL file.
+
+               (c)    Representations.
+          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
+          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
+          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
+          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
+          this License.
+
+     3.5. Required Notices.
+     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
+     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
+     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
+     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
+     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
+     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
+     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
+     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
+     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
+     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
+     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
+     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
+     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
+     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
+     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
+     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
+     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
+     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
+
+     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
+     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
+     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
+     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
+     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
+     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
+     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
+     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
+     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
+     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
+     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
+     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
+     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
+     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
+     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
+     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
+     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
+     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
+     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
+     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
+     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
+     terms You offer.
+
+     3.7. Larger Works.
+     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
+     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
+     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
+     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
+
+4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
+
+     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
+     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
+     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
+     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
+     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
+     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
+     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
+     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
+     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
+     understand it.
+
+5. Application of this License.
+
+     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
+     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
+
+6. Versions of the License.
+
+     6.1. New Versions.
+     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
+     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
+     will be given a distinguishing version number.
+
+     6.2. Effect of New Versions.
+     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
+     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
+     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
+     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
+     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
+     Covered Code created under this License.
+
+     6.3. Derivative Works.
+     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
+     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
+     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
+     the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
+     "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
+     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
+     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
+     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
+     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
+     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
+     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
+     this License.)
+
+7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
+
+     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
+     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
+     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
+     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
+     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
+     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
+     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
+     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
+     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
+     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
+
+8. TERMINATION.
+
+     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
+     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
+     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
+     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
+     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
+     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
+     shall survive.
+
+     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
+     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
+     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
+     You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:
+
+     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
+     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
+     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
+     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
+     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
+     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
+     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
+     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
+     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
+     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
+     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
+     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
+     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
+     the 60 day notice period specified above.
+
+     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
+     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
+     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
+     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
+     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
+     Participant.
+
+     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
+     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
+     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
+     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
+     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
+     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
+     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
+     license.
+
+     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
+     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
+     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
+     prior to termination shall survive termination.
+
+9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
+
+     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
+     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
+     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
+     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
+     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
+     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
+     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
+     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
+     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
+     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
+     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
+     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
+     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
+     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
+
+10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

+     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
+     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
+     software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
+     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
+     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
+     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
+     rights set forth herein.
+
+11. MISCELLANEOUS.
+
+     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
+     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
+     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
+     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
+     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
+     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
+     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
+     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
+     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
+     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
+     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
+     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
+     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
+     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
+     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
+     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
+     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
+     License.
+
+12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
+
+     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
+     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
+     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
+     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
+     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
+     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
+
+13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
+
+     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
+     "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
+     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
+     Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
+     by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.
