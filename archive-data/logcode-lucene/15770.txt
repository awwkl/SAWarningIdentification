 * LUCENE-3084: MergePolicy.OneMerge.segments was changed from
   SegmentInfos to a List<SegmentInfo>. SegmentInfos itsself was changed
-	to no longer extend Vector<SegmentInfo> (to update code that is using
-	Vector-API, use the new asList() and asSet() methods returning unmodifiable
-	collections; modifying SegmentInfos is now only possible through
-	the explicitely declared methods). IndexWriter.segString() now takes
-	Iterable<SegmentInfo> instead of List<SegmentInfo>. A simple recompile
-	should fix this. MergePolicy and SegmentInfos are internal/experimental
-	APIs not covered by the strict backwards compatibility policy.
