 * The Lucene index format has changed and as a result, once you upgrade, 
   previous versions of Solr will no longer be able to read your indices.
+  In a master/slave configuration, all searchers/slaves should be upgraded
+  before the master.  If the master were to be updated first, the older
+  searchers would not be able to read the new index format.
 
 * The experimental ALIAS command has been removed (SOLR-1637)
