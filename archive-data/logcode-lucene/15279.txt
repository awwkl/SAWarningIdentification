 replication, and it powers the search and navigation features of many of the world's largest
 internet sites.

 Solr is written in Java and runs as a standalone full-text search server within a servlet
 container such as Tomcat. Solr uses the Lucene Java search library at its core for full-text
 indexing and search, and has REST-like HTTP/XML and JSON APIs that make it easy to use
 from virtually any programming language. Solr's powerful external configuration allows it
 to be tailored to almost any type of application without Java coding, and it has an extensive
 plugin architecture when more advanced customization is required.
