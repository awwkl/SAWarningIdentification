 * SOLR-1825: SolrQuery.addFacetQuery now enables facets automatically, like

-* SOLR-2452: Rewrote the Solr build system:
-  - Integrated more fully with the Lucene build system: generalized the
-    Lucene build system and eliminated duplication.
-  - Converted all Solr contribs to the Lucene/Solr conventional src/ layout:
-    java/, resources/, test/, and test-files/.
-  - Created a new Solr-internal module named "core" by moving the java/,
-    test/, and test-files/ directories from solr/src/ to solr/core/src/.
-  - Merged solr/src/webapp/src/ into solr/core/src/java/.
-  - Eliminated solr/src/ by moving all its directories up one level;
-    renamed solr/src/site/ to solr/site-src/ because solr/site/ already
-    exists.
-  - Merged solr/src/common/ into solr/solrj/src/java/.
-  - Moved o.a.s.client.solrj.* and o.a.s.common.* tests from
-    solr/src/test/ to solr/solrj/src/test/.
-  - Made the solrj tests not depend on the solr core tests by moving
-    some classes from solr/src/test/ to solr/test-framework/src/java/.
-  - Each internal module (core/, solrj/, test-framework/, and webapp/)
-    now has its own build.xml, from which it is possible to run
