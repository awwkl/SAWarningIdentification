+Lucene-Sandbox README file
+
+
+
+INTRODUCTION
+
+Lucene is a Java full-text search engine.  Lucene is not a complete
+application, but rather a code library and API that can easily be used
+to add search capabilities to applications.
+
+The Lucene Sanbox is a place for contributions that are not part of
+the core Lucene distribution. These contributions will not be part of
+distribution.
+The Sandbox is also for creating new subprojects in Lucene that may
+require restructuring of Lucene code.
+
+NOTE: All contributions must be under the APL license to be part of this
+repository.
+
+The basic structure for the respository is
+
+jakarta-lucene-sandbox/README.txt
