+* SOLR-6780: Fixed a bug in how default/appends/invariants params were affecting the set 
+  of all "keys" found in the request parameters, resulting in some key=value param pairs 
+  being duplicated.  This was noticeably affecting some areas of the code where iteration 
+  was done over the set of all params: 
+    - literal.* in ExtractingRequestHandler
+    - facet.* in FacetComponent
+    - spellcheck.[dictionary name].* and spellcheck.collateParam.* in SpellCheckComponent

+  - Added langid.maxFieldValueChars and langid.maxTotalChars params to limit

+  - Moved input concatenation to Tika implementation; the langdetect
+    implementation instead appends each input piece via the langdetect API.
+  (Vitaliy Zhovtyuk, Tomás Fernández Löbbe, Rob Tulloh, Steve Rowe)

+  parenthesis in JAVA_HOME. (Timothy Potter, Christopher Hewitt, Jan Høydahl)
+  
+* SOLR-7067: bin/solr won't run under bash 4.2+. (Steve Rowe)
+
+* SOLR-7033, SOLR-5961: RecoveryStrategy should not publish any state when
