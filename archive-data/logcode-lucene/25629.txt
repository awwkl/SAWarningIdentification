+Lucene project also contains a workspace, Lucene Sandbox, that is open to all Lucene committers, as well
+as a few other developers.  The purpose of the Sandbox is to host various third party contributions,
+and to serve as a place to try out new ideas and prepare them for inclusion into the core Lucene
+distribution.
+Users are free to experiment with the components developed in the Sandbox, but Sandbox components will
+not necessarily be maintained, particularly in their current state.
+<P>
+You can access Lucene Sandbox CVS repository at
+<A HREF="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/jakarta-lucene-sandbox/">http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/jakarta-lucene-sandbox/</A>.
