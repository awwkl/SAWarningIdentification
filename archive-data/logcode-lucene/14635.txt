 Solr is written in Java and runs as a standalone full-text search server within a servlet
 container such as Tomcat. Solr uses the Lucene Java search library at its core for full-text
 indexing and search, and has REST-like HTTP/XML and JSON APIs that make it easy to use
 from virtually any programming language. Solr's powerful external configuration allows it
 to be tailored to almost any type of application without Java coding, and it has an extensive
 plugin architecture when more advanced customization is required.

+The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Solr 3.4.0!
+
+Solr's version number was synced with Lucene following the Lucene/Solr merge, so Solr
+3.4.0 contains Lucene 3.4.0.

+If you are already using Apache Solr 3.1, 3.2 or 3.3, we strongly recommend you upgrade
+to 3.4.0 because of the index corruption bug on OS or computer crash or power loss
+(LUCENE-3418), now fixed in 3.4.0.
+
+Solr 3.4.0 release highlights include
+
+?? Bug fixes and improvements from Apache Lucene 3.4.0, including a major bug
+    (LUCENE-3418) whereby a Lucene index could easily become corrupted if the OS or
+    computer crashed or lost power.
+
+?? SolrJ client can now parse grouped and range facets results (SOLR-2523).
+?? A new XsltUpdateRequestHandler allows posting XML that's transformed by a
+
+    provided XSLT into a valid Solr document (SOLR-2630).
+?? Post-group faceting option (group.truncate) can now compute facet counts for only
+
+    the highest ranking documents per-group. (SOLR-2665).
+?? Add commitWithin update request parameter to all update handlers that were
+
+    previously missing it. This tells Solr to commit the change within the specified amount of
+    time (SOLR-2540).
+?? You can now specify NIOFSDirectory (SOLR-2670).
+?? New parameter hl.phraseLimit speeds up FastVectorHighlighter
+    (LUCENE-3234).
+?? The query cache and filter cache can now be disabled per request. See this wiki page
+    (SOLR-2429).
+?? Improved memory usage, build time, and performance of SynonymFilterFactory
+    (LUCENE-3233).
+?? Added omitPositions to the schema, so you can omit position information while still
+    indexing term frequencies (LUCENE-2048).

+3.3 28 July 2011 - WARNING: Index corruption and crashes in Apache Lucene Core /
 Apache Solr with Java 7
 
 Oracle released Java 7 today. Unfortunately it contains hotspot compiler optimizations,
 which miscompile some loops. This can affect code of several Apache projects. Sometimes
 JVMs only crash, but in several cases, results calculated can be incorrect, leading to bugs in
 applications (see Hotspot bugs 7070134, 7044738, 7068051).
+
 Apache Lucene Core and Apache Solr are two Apache projects, which are affected by
 these bugs, namely all versions released until today. Solr users with the default configuration
 will have Java crashing with SIGSEGV as soon as they start to index documents, as one
 affected part is the well-known Porter stemmer (see LUCENE-3335). Other loops in Lucene

 pulsing codec; other loops may be affected, too - LUCENE-3346).

 These problems were detected only 5 days before the official Java 7 release, so Oracle had no
 time to fix those bugs, affecting also many more applications. In response to our questions,
 they proposed to include the fixes into service release u2 (eventually into service release

 before Update 2! If you do, please don't open bug reports, it is not the committers' fault! At
 least disable loop optimizations using the -XX:-UseLoopPredicate JVM option to not
 risk index corruptions.
+
 Please note: Also Java 6 users are affected, if they use one of those JVM options,
 which are not enabled by default: -XX:+OptimizeStringConcat or -XX:

 It is strongly recommended not to use any hotspot optimization switches in any Java version
 without extensive testing!
