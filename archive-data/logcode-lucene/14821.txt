 ======================= Lucene 3.5.0 =======================
 
+Changes in backwards compatibility policy
+
+* LUCENE-3390: The first approach in Lucene 3.4.0 for missing values
+  support for sorting had a design problem that made the missing value
+  be populated directly into the FieldCache arrays during sorting,
+  leading to concurrency issues. To fix this behaviour, the method
+  signatures had to be changed:
+  - FieldCache.getUnValuedDocs() returns the interface Bits instead DocIdSet
+  - FieldComparator.setMissingValue() was removed and added to
+    constructor
+  As this is expert API, most code will not be affected.
