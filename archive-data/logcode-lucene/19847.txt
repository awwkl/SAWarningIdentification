+Files in this directory are automatically generated from your Rails Engines.
+They are copied from the 'public' directories of each engine into this directory
+each time Rails starts (server, console... any time 'start_engine' is called).
+Any edits you make will NOT persist across the next server restart; instead you
+should edit the files within the <plugin_name>/assets/ directory itself.
