- 2. LUCENE-1687: All methods and parsers from interface ExtendedFieldCache
-    were moved into FieldCache. ExtendedFieldCache was deprecated and now
-    contains only a few declarations for binary backwards compatibility and
-    will be removed in version 3.0. Users of FieldCache and ExtendedFieldCache
-    will therefore be able to plugin Lucene 2.9 without recompilation.
-    The auto cache (FieldCache.getAuto) was deprecated. Due to the merge of
-    ExtendedFieldCache and FieldCache, this method can now additionally return
-    long[] arrays in addition to int[] and float[] and StringIndex.
