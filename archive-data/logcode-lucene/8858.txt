 Upgrading from Solr 4.2.0
 ----------------------
 
-* SOLR-4623: The output path for copyFields and dynamicFields has been changed
-  from all lowercase "copyfields" and "dynamicfields" to camelCase "copyFields"
-  and "dynamicFields", respectively, to align with all other schema REST API
-  outputs, which use camelCase.  The URL format remains the same: all resource
-  names are lowercase.
+* In the schema REST API, the output path for copyFields and dynamicFields 
+  has been changed from all lowercase "copyfields" and "dynamicfields" to

+  the same: all resource names are lowercase.  See SOLR-4623 for details.
   
-* SOLR-3706: Slf4j/logging jars are no longer included in the Solr webapp. All 
-  logging jars are now in example/lib/ext. If you are using another webapp 
-  container, these jars will need to go in the corresponding location for that 
-  container. Changing logging impls is now as easy as updating the jars in this 
-  folder with those necessary for the logging impl you would like. For more 
-  details, see the Slf4j documentation.
-
-* SOLR-4651: The dist-excl-slf4j build target no longer exists.  SOLR-3706
-  eliminated the dist-war-excl-slf4j target and made dist-excl-slf4j
-  redundant.
