-New users of Solr 1.4 will have omitTermFreqAndPositions enabled for non-text indexed fields by
-default, which avoids indexing term frequency, positions, and payloads, making
-the index smaller and faster.  If you are upgrading from an earlier Solr
-release and want to enable omitTermFreqAndPositions by default, change the schema version from
-1.1 to 1.2 in schema.xml.  Remove any existing index and restart Solr to ensure that omitTermFreqAndPositions
-completely takes affect.
