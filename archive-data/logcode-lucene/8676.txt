 * LUCENE-4997: Internal test framework's tests are sensitive to previous

-* LUCENE-4953: Fixed ParallelCompositeReader to inform ReaderClosedListeners of
-  its synthetic subreaders. FieldCaches keyed on the atomic childs will be purged
-  earlier and FC insanity prevented.  In addition, ParallelCompositeReader's
-  toString() was changed to better reflect the reader structure.

 * LUCENE-4959: Fix incorrect return value in
   SimpleNaiveBayesClassifier.assignClass. (Alexey Kutin via Adrien Grand)
 
-* LUCENE-4968: Fixed ToParentBlockJoinQuery/Collector: correctly handle parent
