+Bugs:
+	- some relative URLs are not appended appropriately, leading to wrong and growing URLs
+	  - 301/302 URLs were not updated: the docs were saved under the old URL, which lead to
+	    wrong relative URLs (cmarschner, 2002-06-17)
+
+URLs: 
+	- include a URLNormalizer
+	  * lowercase host names
+	  * avoid ambiguities like '%20' / '+'
+	  * make sure http://host URLs end with "/"
+	  * avoid host name aliases
+	    - two host names / one ip adress can point to the same web site: www.lmu.de / www.uni-muenchen.de
+	    - two host names / one ip adress can point to different web sites (then other URLs / pages must differ)
+	      suche.lmu.de / interesse.lmu.de
+	  * cater 301/302 result codes
+	STATUS: seems to be solved except that URL parameters can occur in different orders, which is NOT resolved
+		host names are resolved by hand, via a synonym in HostManager. (cmarschner, 2002-06-17)
+		problem: URLMessage size doubles

 * Bugs
 	- on very fast LAN connections (100MBit), sockets are not freed as fast as allocated
-	- some relative URLs are not appended appropriately, leading to wrong and growing URLs
+	  probably this will be solved by changing from HTTPClient.* to Jakarta HTTP client and reuse sockets
+
 
 * Build
 	- added build.xml, but build.bat and build.sh are still working without ANT. Change that.
