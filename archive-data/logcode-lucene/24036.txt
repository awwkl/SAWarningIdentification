-- Modify top-level build.xml to build contrib area.
-
-- Implement javadoc w/ groups
-
-- Add download of dependencies
-
-- Add conditional hooks to allow build to succeed even without 3rd party dependencies
-
-- migrate other sandbox pieces over to contrib
-
----------------------------
-
-Notes from e-mail thread:
-Here's my proposal:
-  1. Move sandbox/contributions to src/contrib;
-  2. Change build.xml to build, test & package sandbox packages too.
-  3. Change sandbox build.xml's to build in a top-level build/contrib directory, and package into a top-level dist/contrib directory, so that no files are written in src/contrib.
-
-Once this is done, then:
-
- "ant compile" will compile all core and contributed code, building something like:
-
-    build/
-      classes/  -- core classes
-      contrib/
-        highlighter/ -- highlighter classes
-        ...
-
- "ant test" will test all core and contributed code
-
- "ant dist" will create something like:
-
-      dist/
-        lucene-XX.tar.gz
-        lucene-src-XX.tar.gz
-        lucene-XX.zip
-        lucene-src-XX.zip
-        contrib/
-          highligher-XX.tar.gz
-          ...
-
-And so on.
-
-
-Also, we should combine the javadoc into a single tree, with a "Core" group followed by a "Contrib" group:
-
-http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/tooldocs/solaris/javadoc.html#group
-
-As an example, Nutch does this for "Core" and "Plugin":
