+This directory contains shell scripts which provided the original
+replication & backup functionality dating back to Solr 1.1.  These
+scripts only work on systems that support removing open hard links and
+were superseded by the ReplicationHandler in Solr 1.4.
+
+These scripts are no longer actively maintained, improved, or tested,
+but they have been left in the source tree for use by legacy users who
+are satisfied with their basic functionality. 
+
+For more information on how these scripts can be used, please consult
+the wiki...
