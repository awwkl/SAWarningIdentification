-   * 
-   * <p>If readers/searchers are using the index, then free
-   * space required is up to 2X the size of the starting
-   * index.  This is because in addition to the 1X used by
-   * optimize, the original 1X of the starting index is
-   * still consuming space in the Directory as the readers
-   * are holding the segments files open.  Even on Unix,
-   * where it will appear as if the files are gone ("ls"
-   * won't list them), they still consume storage due to
-   * "delete on last close" semantics.</p>
-   * 
-   * <p>Furthermore, if some but not all readers re-open
-   * while the optimize is underway, this will cause > 2X
-   * temporary space to be consumed as those new readers
-   * will then hold open the partially optimized segments at
-   * that time.  It is best not to re-open readers while
-   * optimize is running.</p>

+   * <p>Note that optimize requires 2X the index size free
+   * space in your Directory.  For example, if your index
+   * size is 10 MB then you need 20 MB free for optimize to
+   * complete.</p>
