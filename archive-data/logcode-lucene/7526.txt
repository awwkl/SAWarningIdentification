-* LUCENE-4998: Fixed a few places to pass IOContext.READONCE instead
-  of IOContext.READ (Shikhar Bhushan via Mike McCandless)
-
-* LUCENE-5242: DirectoryTaxonomyWriter.replaceTaxonomy did not fully reset
-  its state, which could result in exceptions being thrown, as well as
-  incorrect ordinals returned from getParent. (Shai Erera)
-
-* LUCENE-5254: Fixed bounded memory leak, where objects like live
-  docs bitset were not freed from an starting reader after reopening
-  to a new reader and closing the original one.  (Shai Erera, Mike
-  McCandless)
-
-* LUCENE-5262: Fixed file handle leaks when multiple attempts to open an 
-  NRT reader hit exceptions. (Shai Erera)
-
-* LUCENE-5263: Transient IOExceptions, e.g. due to disk full or file
-  descriptor exhaustion, hit at unlucky times inside IndexWriter could
-  lead to silently losing deletions. (Shai Erera, Mike McCandless)

-* LUCENE-5264: CommonTermsQuery ignored minMustMatch if only high-frequent
-  terms were present in the query and the high-frequent operator was set
-  to SHOULD. (Simon Willnauer)

-* LUCENE-5269: Fix bug in NGramTokenFilter where it would sometimes count
-  unicode characters incorrectly. (Mike McCandless, Robert Muir)

 * LUCENE-5272: OpenBitSet.ensureCapacity did not modify numBits, causing 
   false assertion errors in fastSet. (Shai Erera)
 
-* LUCENE-5289: IndexWriter.hasUncommittedChanges was returning false
-  when there were buffered delete-by-Term.  (Shalin Shekhar Mangar,
