   that allows to upgrade all segments to last recent supported index
   format without fully optimizing.  (Uwe Schindler, Mike McCandless)
 
-Optimizations
+* LUCENE-1076: Added TieredMergePolicy which is able to merge non-contiguous 
+  segments, which means docIDs no longer necessarily stay "in order".
+  (Mike McCandless, Shai Erera)
 
-* LUCENE-2990: ArrayUtil/CollectionUtil.*Sort() methods now exit early
-  on empty or one-element lists/arrays.  (Uwe Schindler)
+* LUCENE-3071: Adding ReversePathHierarchyTokenizer, added skip parameter to 
+  PathHierarchyTokenizer (Olivier Favre via ryan)
 
 API Changes
 
+* LUCENE-3061: IndexWriter's getNextMerge() and merge(OneMerge) are now public
+  (though @lucene.experimental), allowing for custom MergeScheduler 
+  implementations. (Shai Erera)
+
 * LUCENE-3065: Document.getField() was deprecated, as it throws
   ClassCastException when loading lazy fields or NumericFields.

 Bug fixes
 
+* LUCENE-2996: addIndexes(IndexReader) did not flush before adding the new 
+  indexes, causing existing deletions to be applied on the incoming indexes as 
+  well. (Shai Erera, Mike McCandless)

 * LUCENE-3024: Index with more than 2.1B terms was hitting AIOOBE when
   seeking TermEnum (eg used by Solr's faceting) (Tom Burton-West, Mike

+Test Cases
