-* LUCENE-5919: Fix exception handling inside IndexWriter when
-  deleteFile throws an exception, to not over-decRef index files,
-  possibly deleting a file that's still in use in the index, leading
-  to corruption.  (Mike McCandless)
-
-* LUCENE-5922: DocValuesDocIdSet on 5.x and FieldCacheDocIdSet on 4.x
-  are not cacheable. (Adrien Grand)

 * LUCENE-5934: Fix backwards compatibility for 4.0 indexes.

 * LUCENE-5838: Fix hunspell when the .aff file has over 64k affixes. (Robert Muir)
 
-* LUCENE-5844: ArrayUtil.grow/oversize now returns a maximum of
-  Integer.MAX_VALUE - 8 for the maximum array size.  (Robert Muir,
-  Mike McCandless)
-
-* LUCENE-5843: Added IndexWriter.MAX_DOCS which is the maximum number
-  of documents allowed in a single index, and any operations that add
-  documents will now throw IllegalStateException if the max count
-  would be exceeded, instead of silently creating an unusable
-  index.  (Mike McCandless)
-
 * LUCENE-5869: Added restriction to positive values for maxExpansions in
   FuzzyQuery.  (Ryan Ernst)
 
 * LUCENE-5672: IndexWriter.addIndexes() calls maybeMerge(), to ensure the index stays
   healthy. If you don't want merging use NoMergePolicy instead. (Robert Muir)
   
-* LUCENE-5897, LUCENE-5400: JFlex-based tokenizers StandardTokenizer and
-  UAX29URLEmailTokenizer tokenize extremely slowly over long sequences of

-  buffer size was reduced, and scanner buffer growth was disabled, resulting
-  in much, much faster tokenization for these text sequences.

+* LUCENE-5907: Fix corruption case when opening a pre-4.x index with
+  IndexWriter, then opening an NRT reader from that writer, then
+  calling commit from the writer, then closing the NRT reader.  This
+  case would remove the wrong files from the index leading to a
+  corrupt index.  (Mike McCandless)
