-* LUCENE-2386: IndexWriter no longer performs an empty commit upon new index
-  creation. Previously, if you passed an empty Directory and set OpenMode to
-  CREATE*, IndexWriter would make a first empty commit. If you need that 
-  behavior you can call writer.commit()/close() immediately after you create it.

-* LUCENE-2316: Directory.fileLength contract was clarified - it returns the
-  actual file's length if the file exists, and throws FileNotFoundException
-  otherwise. Returning length=0 for a non-existent file is no longer allowed. If
-  you relied on that, make sure to catch the exception. (Shai Erera)

 * LUCENE-2265: FuzzyQuery and WildcardQuery now operate on Unicode codepoints,
   not unicode code units. For example, a Wildcard "?" represents any unicode

+* LUCENE-2589: Add a VariableSizedIntIndexInput, which, when used w/
