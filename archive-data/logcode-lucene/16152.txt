-Note: As of version 1.3, Solr no longer comes bundled with a Python client.  The existing client
-was not sufficiently maintained or tested as development of Solr progressed, and committers
-felt that the code was not up to our usual high standards of release.
-
-The client bundled with previous versions of Solr will continue to be available indefinitely at:
-http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/lucene/solr/tags/release-1.2.0/client/python/
-
-Please see http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolPython for information on third-party Solr python
-clients.
