      - Show me all 'Super hero' movies:
        http://localhost:8983/solr/films/query?q=*:*&fq=genre:%22Superhero%20movie%22
 
      - Let's see the distribution of genres across all the movies. See the facet section for the counts:
        http://localhost:8983/solr/films/query?q=*:*&facet=true&facet.field=genre
 
+     - Browse the indexed films in a traditional browser search interface:

+FAQ:
+  Why override the schema of the _name_ and _initial_release_date_ fields?
+
+     Without overriding those field types, the _name_ field would have been guessed as a multi-valued string field type
+     and _initial_release_date_ would have been guessed as a multi-valued tdate type.  It makes more sense in our application
+     to have the movie name be a single valued general full-text searchable field, and for the release date also to be single valued.
+
+  How do I clear and reset my environment?
+
+     bin/solr stop
+     rm -Rf server/solr/films/
+     # then start from the beginning of the instructions to start fresh
