+* LUCENE-2060: Changed ConcurrentMergeScheduler's default for
+  maxNumThreads from 3 to 1, because in practice we get the most
+  gains from running a single merge in the background.  More than one
+  concurrent merge causes a lot of thrashing (though it's possible on
+  SSD storage that there would be net gains).  (Jason Rutherglen,
