 /**
  * Abstract base class for sorting hits returned by a Query.
- *
- * <p>This class should only be used if the other SortField
- * types (SCORE, DOC, STRING, INT, FLOAT) do not provide an
- * adequate sorting.  It maintains an internal cache of values which
- * could be quite large.  The cache is an array of Comparable,
- * one for each document in the index.  There is a distinct
- * Comparable for each unique term in the field - if
- * some documents have the same term in the field, the cache
- * array will have entries which reference the same Comparable.
