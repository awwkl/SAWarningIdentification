# SAWarningIdentification (SAWI)
## Introduction
* This repository is a fork of a project that holds the source code and experimental data of the paper `Is There A "Golden" Feature Set for Static Warning Identification? - An Experimental Evaluation` in ESEM2018. 
* Most of the files (and hard work) in this project should be attributed to the authors of the original project/paper, and the resources they referenced.
* This fork was created to provide documentation on how to run the project, as well as (possible) future extensions
